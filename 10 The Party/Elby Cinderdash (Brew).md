Dragonborn Bard

[Complete backstory here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kCYL-n-Ef8hgJOnDDW2yf36AA-WvBsK9O6JlzQ4Jdwk/edit)

Elby stands out among the 7 of Bahamut’s chosen in that he is the only one who is not either a paladin or cleric. He’s a Bard who thinks of himself as more a “partner” with “Big Shiny” (his name for Bahamut).  Elby is irreverent and borderline arrogant.  He does the right thing when needed, but it’s often for thrills and attention rather than a dedication to service of others.

The story is, Elby tricked and conned his way into being one of Bahamut’s chosen.  (Or, at least he thinks he did)  He really is just “that damn good” at what he does.  But he is never humble about it.  As part of the challenges and trials to be chosen, Elby had to fight the strongest of Bahamut’s Chosen, an ancient gold dragon named [[Dhazar Zarakas]] “Dhaorandaurzaras”.  Dhazar, paladin,  scoffed at having to fight Elby.  He made the mistake of letting Elby talk him into letting him choose the weapons used in their duel.  Elby selected mandolins as the weapons to be used.  This choice of an instrument as a weapon confounded [[Dhazar Zarakas|Dhazar]] just enough for Elby to not only show his prowess (he didn’t have to win, just show well enough) but actually knock [[Dhazar Zarakas|Dhazar]] flat on his ass.

Thus, Elby ascended to his place among the Chosen.  Once he got there though, he realized he really didn’t have any idea what he did it all for other than just to get attention.  Now, he understands just how NOT in the spotlight he is.  So his arrogance has backfired on him.  [[Drawg Stormbrew (Brew)|Drawg]] is the only one among the Chosen that truly likes and appreciates Elby.  [[Drawg Stormbrew (Brew)|Drawg]] loves the music, acrobatics and juggling Elby is so good at.  He loves to be entertained.  LOL.

The TRUTH is, deep down, Elby wants to be accepted by Bahmut.  He’s just too proud to admit this.  He sees his con and use of guile to become one of the Chosen as proof he doesn’t really belong.  But, he doesn’t think he could have done it any other way.  Bahamut actually loves Elby for all this and all the ways he is different from the others.  He wants for Elby to learn for himself that he is worthy.  That is another reason he has sent Elby and [[Drawg Stormbrew (Brew)|Drawg]] to Wildmount. This is a learning experience for Elby.  When he changes Elby to his canary form, Elby has no choice but to watch [[Drawg Stormbrew (Brew)|Drawg]] and learn from him.  Also, he has to learn humility and appreciation for his gifts because as a canary (even a magic one) he can’t do much.  This is a penance for Elby.

Elby and the red dragon Ashardalon have beef.

My name is Durawgrathnorastrumbra, one of Bahamut's Chosen Seven. I bring with me the weight and burden of the Platinum Father's Justice / Vengeance / Voice / Mercy.  That which you will now feel.  For as you are in my presence, SO YOU ARE IN HIS!
