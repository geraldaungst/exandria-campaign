[[Eidechse Backstory]]

[Complete backstory here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mEzdpvxn8StQ0V4GUxuFK0QZqfSdH6zubfJIKty2WEs/edit?tab=t.0)

I grew up in Kamordah in the Bromkiln Hills, known for their rugged terrain, dense forests, and rich mineral deposits, my family were miners and tradespeople.

My father, Kazgor, and mother, Elfrida, of the Stonebreaker Clan.  While most of the clan navigated the depths of the hills to find mineral deposits, my parents would bring our goods across the lands to popular merchant posts and to nobles who requested Adamantite for their knights' weapons and armor.

As a child, I galavanted through the rugged terrain of the deep forest above ground and played in the ancient ruins. I was enamored with the living creatures that existed above ground.  Below ground, you might come across a cavern crab or the occasional glow worm.  But above ground, there were whimsical creatures like squirrels, birds, and deer!  My affinity for them helped me to learn patience and form bonds with the local wildlife.

As you can probably imagine, I got myself in trouble from time to time, running into goblins and giant spiders!  Often with the help from my forest friends, I was able to evade or escape these pesky monsters! These escapades above ground gave me wisdom and experience.

In my teen years, my parents began to take me on trips around the Menagerie Coast.  Seeing the world outside of my tunnels and forest brought on new perspectives.  We met other dwarf clans deep in the mountains with caverns filled with gemstones that made my home tunnels look like a toddlers playground.  We visited fantastical castles of human kings and queens with colorful tapestries and towering stone walls.  We visited cities filled with buildings and people from all over the continent all mixed up in one place.

As the years went on and I learned the tricks of the tradespeople, I gained an affinity for the coast!  Often filled with fabulous tropical fauna and colorful creatures, I started to find myself at home in the small forests and beaches of the Lucidian Ocean coasts.  As my interests leaned further into the exotic organisms of the world and less on minerals and rocks deep within it, I broke free from my family to explore nature.

I traveled among the islands and beaches for several years, learning about the nature I had become so fond of and taking on various jobs and quests of a ranger to make ends meet.  I would often go looking for exotic plants and animals for various sorcerers and noble people who wanted something pretty for their gardens or needed particular ingredients for potions.

# A Magical Awakening: Finding Your Marine Iguana Companion

Scenario:

![[eichechse.png|right|300]]Your ranger, a hill dwarf, has been tasked with a mission to explore the Menagerie Coast and search for a rare species of marine iguana. As you journey through the coastal jungles, you encounter a powerful, ancient spirit of the forest. This spirit, sensing your deep connection to nature and your determination to find your companion, offers you a gift.

The Gift:

The spirit grants you the ability to communicate with animals, particularly those of the reptile family. As you continue your journey, you begin to hear the faintest whispers and rustles in the undergrowth. Following these sounds, you stumble upon a hidden cove where a group of marine iguanas are basking in the sun. Among them is a particularly large and majestic iguana that seems to draw your attention.

As you approached the marine iguana, a surge of energy washed over you. You felt a deep connection to the creature, as if your spirits were intertwined. A soft voice whispered in your mind, "My name is Surge. I have been waiting for you."

Surge was a magnificent creature, with scales that shimmered like emeralds in the sunlight. Her eyes held a wisdom that belied her young age, and her powerful tail thrashed the water into a frenzy. You knew instantly that Surge was the companion you had been searching for.

With a newfound sense of purpose, you reached out to Surge, your hand trembling slightly. To your surprise, the iguana did not flinch or retreat. Instead, she nuzzled her head against your palm, purring softly. In that moment, you knew that your journey had been worth it.
