Gnome Druid-Barbarian

[Complete backstory here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15vSp6JmG4ok54__3cEXE_5Mj11Puqm1B4z69f9TKXIU/edit)

Popcorn (M, 35 y/o) was born and raised in Tal'Dorei, on the outskirts of Jorenn Village. His family runs a small flower and herbalist shop in the village.

Popcorn is the son of Felix (M, 150 y/o) and Nifi (F, 148 y/o), and the youngest of eight children. His siblings are Brocc (M, 100 y/o), Wrenn (F, 97 y/o), Gaerick (M, 85 y/o), Grinda (F, 85 y/o), Lyda (F, 80 y/o), Zindira (F, 78 y/o), and Zook (M, 65 y/o). Popcorn is often the butt of the joke, as his parents let it slip that he was an “oops” baby. His siblings also gave him his nickname, Popcorn, because of his hot-tempered and often explosive nature. His closest sibling is his sister, Lyda. She looks out for him and calls off the others when they gang up on him. Lyda is the only person who calls Popcorn by his real name, Pytr. Often feeling like an outcast, Popcorn would isolate himself by wandering the forests surrounding the outskirts of town, learning all he could about the various flora and fauna of Tal’Dorei. Once, when he was a small child, he had a dream about the forest which he remembers to this day…

“I was walking through the forest and all of a sudden, I found myself in a different realm… Feywild. It almost appeared the same as the forest I had just been wandering in, but the colors were brighter, sounds were clearer, the plants and trees were different, and the creatures were, well, they were Fey. Pixies danced above my head and centaurs galloped past me; I sat in awe at the sight of massive treants… after a few hours I explained that I had to return home… I had a family that was counting on me. The Fey insisted that I stay, but I was persistent and convinced one of the satyrs to show me the way back through the Fey crossing. The satyr gave me his pan flute as a parting gift, and opened the portal. As soon as I passed through into our realm, it was if I had awoken from a dream, although I still felt sleepy. I walked back to my family’s home and opened the door to find my parents and siblings rushing toward me with tears in their eyes. They said I had been missing for days… but how could that be? I had only fallen asleep in the forest for a few hours… After that day, my family was often over-protective of me, and refused to let me go into the woods without a companion. Oh, and I forgot about the pan flute! When I got home that night I reached into my pockets and found it there… I still can’t explain where that came from. Sometimes when I’m missing home I’ll take it out and play it. I often think I’m going crazy; when I stop playing I swear I can hear the pixies from my dream giggling.”

As Popcorn grew up, he found solace in the wilds surrounding Jorenn Village. The forests became his sanctuary, a place where he could escape the taunts of his siblings and the expectations of his family. In the embrace of nature, he felt a sense of belonging that eluded him within the confines of the village.

One fateful day, while exploring deeper into the woods than ever before, Popcorn stumbled upon a clearing bathed in dappled sunlight. Entranced by the serene beauty of the place, he felt a strange, primal energy coursing through him, awakening something long dormant within his soul.

It was in that moment that he had his first encounter with the primal spirits of the wilderness. They whispered ancient secrets to him, teaching him to harness the raw power of nature itself. Guided by their wisdom, Popcorn began to unlock abilities he never knew he possessed, tapping into the primal forces of the earth, air, fire, and water.

But as he delved deeper into his newfound connection with nature, Popcorn discovered that not all of its aspects were gentle or serene. The wilderness could be as savage and unforgiving as it was beautiful, and he found himself drawn to its wild, untamed essence.

Driven by a burning desire to embrace his true nature, Popcorn embraced the primal fury that simmered within him. He learned to channel his explosive temper into a formidable force, becoming a whirlwind of rage and destruction when provoked.
