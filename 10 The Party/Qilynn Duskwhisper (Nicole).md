Half-elf Rogue

[Complete backstory here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eHMFKylWK_U6Hap1qfR5OlVD2ntpUrXB-TRP7qt6gN8/edit)

Born in the bustling city of [[Port Damali]], Qilynn spent her early years in the shadowy alleys and cobbled streets, where the salty breeze off the Lucidian Ocean mixed with the scent of fish and adventure. Her mother, a tavern wench in the heart of the port, filled their small home with songs and laughter.

Tragedy struck when Qilynn's mother was killed by an unknown assailant, leaving her orphaned at a tender age. With no father to speak of and no siblings to lean on, she was forced to fend for herself. The tavern's generous patrons, enchanted by her innocent spirit, would often sneak her sweets and small trinkets.

Desperate and alone, she turned to the streets for survival, learning the art of trickery and stealth from the unsavory characters that frequented the tavern. But when the tavern's owner, once a benefactor, turned his back on her shortly after her mother’s death, she was forced to take more drastic measures. The Clasp beckoned, and she fell into the world of pickpocketing and burglary for the syndicate

One fateful job changed the course of her life. Tasked with robbing a fiendish high elf of his most coveted possession - a scroll, she found herself ensnared by the magic traps of his office. The high elf, known as [[Aelorin Nightshade]], was not like any adversary she had encountered. Instead of punishing her, a Clasp member, himself, he saw potential in the young half-elf and decided to turn her misdeeds into an opportunity.

Under [[Aelorin Nightshade|Aelorin]]'s rigorous tutelage, Qilynn's skills were honed. Yet, despite her progress, there was always an undercurrent of disappointment from [[Aelorin Nightshade|Aelorin]], who never let her forget her mixed heritage and her lack of skill with magic like his own. She grew bitter as she realized he would not advance her training. 

Qilynn's journey took a harsh turn when a mission to steal a prized artifact for [[Aelorin Nightshade|Aelorin]]'s secret vendetta ended in failure - a mission she created herself to win his favor and without [[Aelorin Nightshade|Aelorin]]’s permission. Beaten and scorned, she was cast away, left to find her own path back to redemption. Determined to prove her worth, Qilynn now roams the Menagerie Coast, seeking survival and a mission worthy of the elusive high elf who both trained and rejected her.

Carrying with her the cherished memories of her mother's songs and the little purple dragon carving, Qilynn Duskwhisper steps into the world, ready to carve her own destiny amidst the shadows of Exandria.


## Goals
1. Short term goal: Little bit of revenge? She knows damn well that her last failure was not her fault, but she can't prove it. It's just a hunch. When she figures out who sabotaged the gig, she owes them.
2. Longer term goal: Prove that she's actually a damn good thief. She's had a run of bad luck getting caught on some big jobs, so she's looking for the next big gig - maybe bigger than it needs to be to prove herself. She specifically want to prove herself to her past mentor (big important guy in the Clasp, perhaps?) - both to show him up and to be accepted by him (Doesn't have a father-figure, maybe it's a Daddy issue.)
