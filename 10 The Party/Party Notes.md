# March 8, 2025- AKA \- The 4th of Thunsheer {#march-8,-2025--aka---the-4th-of-thunsheer}

Escaped the dungeon even though Drawg’s stealth is middling at best.  
Returned to Harmony Hall for a **long rest.**  
**Investigating the Letter:**

- Letter is only a day old\! Merryfrond’s day is on the 31st of the month (Currently the 4th of Thunsheer)   
- 

Calderax \- Lavender skinned tiefling

Zehlezo shows up and asks the party to Pier 14\. 

- When they get there, there’s a massive gorilla-like creature \- lurching and unnatural gate  
  - Walking on knuckles and hind legs \- it appears to be not right   
  - Translucent skin \- Internal organs which are glowing with internal light  
  - Back-end appears to have a fishtail  
  - Flesh is fluid \- arrow sinks in  
-  Also find another creature that’s eyes, mouths, and tentacles \- not from this world  
  - Babbling \- a little bit of common, doesn’t make sense, but isn’t complete gibberish  
  - Sprays mucus spit in a 10 foot radius \- Blinding Spittle  
  - Appears to have ‘transformed’ out of a form being that was already there \- something new from the Rift.  


# March 2, 2025 \- Wrong Door {#march-2,-2025---wrong-door}

From the bodies: 

- Blood trail \- tell-tale signs of someone who went back to clean up after themselves to hide and leave no trace, but seems hurried.   
- Bloody footsteps after the deaths \- entering two of the doors \- going into the room above that we’ve already seen & door where Dex is standing. 

So far \- 2 Doors South and 1 North not opened at the beginning

Stitch pattern on south door which is locked, recognizing that this is Aelorin’s room. Saving this one

Qilyn unlocks Other room to the South \- Appears to be austere living quarters \- crates and shelving units \-trunks which are ready \- appears to probably be storage

North door \- Appears to be a study/library area \- Nothing appears to be missing except, the table appears to have been moved \- can tell that someone was hiding behind the table at some point. Small scrap of paper on floor \- parchment torn from something. Just says “RAX” \- part of a word that was ripped from somewhere. There are signs that two other people were in this room. 

Drawg hears someone in the pile of stuff \- it looks haphazard, but was actually intentionally arranged. They open the locked door: 

- The room appears to be swiftly vacated  
- There is a RIFT, pools of darkness across the floor  
- Creatures left and right?   
  - Left \- large shadowy dog-like creature \- “Shadow Mastiff”  
  - Right \- very dark \- almost absorbing light with wings, but hard to tell in the dark  
  - Paralyzing screams  
- The Rift that opened in the library \- they shifted the books to another location. It appears as though it might have been there awhile.   
- 2 Hidden Doors \- in the corner.   
- One had a chest with several things put into Drawg’s bag of holding  
- The other is a ladder up to an escape \- the bench is where this is at.   
- Aelorin’s Room \- Trapped with an arrow  
  - Aelorin’s Desk   
    - Ledgers in code \- it has changed since Q was with them  
    - Spell scroll tucked in the ledgers  
    - Inks and pens and parchment are high quality  
    - In a drawer \- single signet ring \- symbol on it, made of silver, and pretty valuable  
  - Also in room \- on bed there is a hidden compartment in headboard  
    - Another 500 platinum pieces  
    - Two sending stones  
  -   
- Calderax’s Room:  
  - Research notes on the desk \- planar magic research, brass pocketwatch, compartment \- 200 gold pieces & Letter to Calderax from Aelorin  
  - Wardrobe \- nice clothing, but out of date \- false bottom and inside is a folded piece of paper \- letter to “My Dear Gentlemen,” \- Signed by Calderax, but doesn’t have the actual corner  
    - 3rd Thunsheer, 835 P.D.  
    - 	My dear Gentleman,  
    - I hope this letter finds you well in Zadash. Our mutual friend has ensured its safe passage, as always. Your generous offer has not gone unnoticed, and I am inclined to accept.  
      The information you seek about the Myriad's operations in Port Damali is as follows:  
      1\. The shipment of Marquesian spices will arrive on the 20th. The usual warehouse will be lightly guarded that night.  
      2\. Aelorin plans to expand our influence into the Tumbledowns next month. Key bribes have already been arranged.  
      3\. The Zhelezo captain in the Opal Archways is now on our payroll. His name is Joren Vex.  
      As for your proposal to "redirect" some of the Myriad's assets, I believe I can arrange it without arousing suspicion. The upcoming Merryfrond's Day celebrations at the end of the month should provide ample distraction.  
      I must stress the need for utmost discretion. My position here grows precarious, and Aelorin's trust is not easily earned back once lost.  
      Our next exchange will follow the usual protocol. Until then, may the Wildmother's winds carry you to prosperity.  
      Your faithful ally,  
    - Calde-- \[The bottom right corner is torn and missing.\]  
      

Appears as though something is missing \- oblong, heavy, 6 inches, fine black particles like micah \- the Myriad are the other major crime syndicate from the clasp. 

Opal Archways \- region of Nicodranus \- also on the coast

# February 16, 2025 \- I’m not drunk, you are.  {#february-16,-2025---i’m-not-drunk,-you-are.}

Hestarian followed dwarf. Drawg and Qilynn follow a girl who left the house who went in the same direction as a black dragonborn. 

Seraphina returned to gather the rest of the team at the theater. 

Qilynn & Drawg’s quarry: Woman in her early 30s \- fair skin, dark brown hair in a braid \- scar under one eye, dark green tunic, leather pants, knee-high boots, dagger on arm \- used a magic scroll to disappear before they could accost her. 

Hestarian knows the house the dwarf went in.

The front door of the tailor shop is open so everyone just goes in. 

Back of the shop \- Investigated \- Quality Tailor tools, drawer with pearl buttons, gold thread, silver clasps, etc. stacks of papers for measurements and etc. and a corner of the work table has reference books for tailor and fashion. On one corner, folded is a formal suit with a note pinned to it “Corfel Withrethen” Note on the suit had a line through it that says “left town and not coming back” and a half-empty bottle of wine, small roll of very valuable silk.

They break into the space below the tailor shop. It is a dungeon area? Secret space. They disable traps. 

Bodies found: Two men who typically work as guards in the hideout. Appeared to be killed by a curved blade.

- Blood trail \- tell-tale signs of someone who went back to clean up after themselves to hide and leave no trace, but seems hurried.   
- Bloody footsteps after the deaths \- entering two of the doors \- going into the room above that we’ve already seen & door where Dex is standing. 

So far \- 2 Doors South and 1 North not opened  
Stitch pattern on south door which is locked, recognizing that this is Aelorin’s room. Saving this one

Qilyn unlocks Other room to the South \- Appears to be austere living quarters \- crates and shelving units \-trunks which are ready

# January 26, 2025 \- Cool House, Bruh {#january-26,-2025---cool-house,-bruh}

Calderax \- Lavender skinned Tiefling, Expensive clothes, sharp-refined facial features and easy to recognize \- humanoid

Aelorin \- Tall elf

Aelorin’s lair \- “Evaldo’s Elegant Attire” \- tall tailor shop is the front \- has more land than most buildings in this part of town. Has a pathway that leads to the front door, two short walls on either side of the front door that separate it further from the road. Entrance is flanked by two clusters of cypress trees which are not common inside the city. 

Drawg smacks Hesterian’s butt and argues w/ Qilynn about going inside. Seraphina sends in Ratt Damon to investigate the inside of the house. Seraphina eventually flies onto the roof and looks in the skylight to glimpse in and see a dwarf, black dragonborn, and female human in the back room heading toward the door to the main room. 

# January 12, 2025 \- Funeral Harmony and Heartbreak {#january-12,-2025---funeral-harmony-and-heartbreak}

I guess we’re going to try to keep the Compass.

Hestarian goes back to her former home of repute (the Mallow turned Theater \- Harmony Hall) and discovers Grizzle is dead and Ana has been given the establishment. Ana offers her half ownership and Hestarian takes it. Hestarian asks about Calderax and Dreyara \- Ana doesn’t know those names. Grizzle’s rooms are investigated and there is a small shrine to “[The Changebringer](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/The_Changebringer).”

- 3 Rooms in Harmony Hall as our parties rooms in addition to Grizzle’s  
- Grizzle’s room \= Hestarian and Drawg

Team goes to Gilded Pearl and waits to see if they can connect with Yrene. 

Calderax has gotten a promotion from Aelorin and he's been taking bigger missions lately. Dreyara \- Yrene doesn’t know much about her (who she is working for now) but one of Yrene’s connections saw her in Port Damali recently. Used to be connected with the Empire \- Specifically used to be in the Valstrucker. (Dwindalian Empire is the region to the north, Rexintrim is the capital. The Valstrucker are the Empire’s secret police \- wizard ninjas \- who have a lot of influence and ‘run’ the government even though they aren’t it.) 

Team leaves so that Qilynn can turn down Yrene… poor Yrene. 

They decide to scope out Aelorin’s place as a team overnight.

# December 22, 2024 \- Almost TPK by Little Shop of Horrors. {#december-22,-2024---almost-tpk-by-little-shop-of-horrors.}

\*The cart got stuck in the mud on the path, so Hestarian, Seraphina, Qilynn, and Drawg are scouting the path. 

🍃Shambling Mounds🍃 attack the group \- Seraphina, Hestarian, and Qilynn get knocked out (Seraphina saves out with a Nat 20, Drawing saves Hestarian Twice, and everyone lets Qilynn fail two saves before the defeat the final creature and pour health potions down her throat.) Drawg rolls for shit pretty much the entire time. They find a path out for the wagon.

Finally get back to Port Damali where several characters will be avoiding plant-based foods… or maybe eating them out of spite.

# December 15, 2024 \- Gig is up. {#december-15,-2024---gig-is-up.}

Radelia \- was on the skyship on business- family business is a textile company. She was at the festival in Whitestone selling garments, but was returning to Odeslo. 

- We return the bag (minus the coin). She doesn’t ask about the coin.

At breakfast, Radelia and Renneth feel comfortable sharing some information: 

- Radelia kept a close eye on Aethor for several days in Port Damali and learned the following about Obsidian Echorforge’s Progress:   
  - Most important thing: Aethor was meeting with a man named Calderax Dunhall at a tavern in the Larboard Light District  
    - Was about something specific that he is looking for but also he is looking for something else.   
  - Aethor was carrying a satchel filled with scrolls and documents most of the time.  
  - He was distracted and lost in thought so Radelia didn’t have to struggle to hide from him when following him.  
  - He was staying at the “Pudgy Pigeon”   
  - It is clear that the ‘selling textiles’ was a cover story to follow Aethor and what his work was.  
  - Over the last few days she also discovered \- Aethor made multiple trips to the Cobalt Soul Library  
  - Aethor has been asking a lot of questions about the anomalies.  
  - At least twice he mentioned the “Lorestone of Eryndor” which the Obsidian EchoForge is attempting to assemble.   
  - She also heard him … for Renneth’s ears only.  
- Radelia also followed Calderax  
  - C had a meeting with Dreyara Drimvar \- She overheard something about a shard of the lorestone.  Dreyara is probably not from the area based on the fact the party doesn’t have any knowledge of her.  
- The beans spilled after we all come clean   
  - Valen Underguard is also associated with Dreyara and the leader of “Emissaries of the Sunfall”  
    - They are a group that Qilynn has heard of \- know that they have a history in Rexxentrum \- Largest city on this continent/capital, Qilynn knows that they are known for seeking out methods of harnessing energy and power for their own benefit and for the benefit of Exandria.  
    - Used to be enemies of the OEF and were violent, but more recently they’ve started working together with OEF and they are attempting to help and they don’t know why the change in heart.  
    - Other person \- “The Eye” was referred to in the conversation. Drawg thinks it is the “Eye of Scars” from Xarzith Kitrill \- old Draconia  
      - Hestarian clearly doesn’t want to go there either.

- ## Additional Mission \- Calderax & Dreyara {#additional-mission---calderax-&-dreyara}

  - Calderax & Dreyara \- They are strongly connected in Port Damali  
  - The Druids are going to look into Underguard/Elderguard and Eye person  
  - We will need to return to shrine in order to reconnect with Redalia and Renneth

The group starts to return to Port Demali

# December 1, 2024 \- We Summon Unicorn Demons for Ideas {#december-1,-2024---we-summon-unicorn-demons-for-ideas}

Qilynn asks to see more about the book. Seraphina explains that this is what the woods looked like a long time ago \- including some of the Fae that would visit.

- The book is not old \- very well-crafted green-leather cover. Made with care   
- Seraphina may be the goddess they’re worshipping? But she is not a deity.  
  - The last entries in the book (journal of Seraphina’s) talk about the corruption of the woods. (cliff-hanger)  
- Obsidian Echoforge \- if the artifact is assembled it will close the rifts  
- Malachite Kord \- if the artifact is assembled it will be catastrophic  
- Hestarian suggests we summon Eolin/wyn \- Seraphina’s Patron Unicorn

They attempt to do this. The entire team chips in. They all seemingly have a different experience.

- Seraphina believes her patron says they need to work with the Druids  
- Popcorn and Hestarian had very different experiences  
- Qilynn heard ‘no’

After a period of discussion, Drawg figures out that everyone experienced what they expected. Seraphina is sore about the fact that Drawg brought Seraphina’s patron into question for reliability. 

# November 17, 2024 \- Chronicles of the Aurora’s Ascendent  {#november-17,-2024---chronicles-of-the-aurora’s-ascendent}

The rift is more-or-less closed now.  
They eat lunch together: 

- Malachite Kord \- “Aurora’s Ascendent”   
  - The MK is a group who follows the teachings of the Aurora’s Ascendent as guardians of balance. In the Savalier Wood, there is a spreading corruption. They believe it is a warning ripple from greater disturbances across Exandria. These corruptions have been spread for three centuries or more. The MK has been studying the corruption and the wood identifying the cause to find a cure. All they have figured out is that these rifts may have a connection to the corruption.  
  - They have different groups investigating different things. This particular group has a ‘different mission’  
    - This group is at odds with Obsidian Echoforge  
    - Kord believes the reunification of the lore stone to end in a major catastrophe  
    - Ancient Elven City of Melaismire \- Elven City in northern part of Wildemont not far from the Savalier Wood. 100 years ago there was an enormous catastrophe that occurred in the city \- they know only that almost overnight the city was destroyed and most of the residence were killed and all of the survivors fled. It became an abandoned ruin.  
    - They fear that reunification of the stone could cause this.   
  - Rift cages are limited in number \- there are only a few and not enough to contain the rifts spreading across Exandria.   
  - Seraphina says we don’t know them.   
  - Rennith shares that Radelia was tracking Aethor Callus and came back with information about their activities.   
  - If we’re willing to help \- there are a couple of things that might be useful. Goal \- to rededicate this shrine to Aurora’s Ascendent  
    - Cleansing and rededication \- next day or two \- cleaning and repairing then the rededication ritual  
    - Other need: Soul Wood is rare \- if we come across Soul Wood, they would greatly appreciate it if we ever come across it.  
  - As we notice (PICTURED), there is a great deal of symbology for The Wild Mother and the MK is adding their own symbology. Many members are carrying this wooden symbol with a green cord  
  - They get their ‘Aurora Ascendant’ story \- “A radiance born under a cosmic dance in the wood \- as lights aloft heralded her birth \- creatures great and small felt the stir of her spirit, a …blah \- raised by mortals and guarded by fae \- corruption around her, but she stayed firm. She commanded nature and stars alight. The shadows battled against her, and she realized the darkness was deeper and she was lifted to the heavens. Guiding light for the Malachite Kord \- they believe her spirit is ever-present. Light endures”   
  - They carry a book known as the “Verdant Codex” that carries the accumulated wisdom. The Ascendent is the “Chosen of Malora”   
  - Seraphina looks at the book and freaks out a little bit \- she finds the religion very interesting. She shows Drawg who has a good laugh.   
  - Popcorn freaks out when he sees the book and runs away. He later explains to Hestarian that he had a dream as a kid where he was gone for days. He woke up with his pan flute in his pocket. Maybe he was in the Faewild? Popcorn says his memory is fuzzy and that he was really young and he remembers some of the creatures in the book and they tried to keep him there, but he was able to get out.   
  - Hestarian and Qilynn look at it. We would be convinced that it was a nature book or journal \- it doesn’t look like a religious text. Drawings of different things in nature in it \- plants, animals, scenes from the forest, notes about random things, corruption in the woods, and then we start to see pictures of creatures that we recognize as fae creatures that would be rare in Exandria.  
    

# November 10, 2024 \- PeeWee Herman’s Hole {#november-10,-2024---peewee-herman’s-hole}

- “Shiny hole” \- Interstellar hole \- Anomaly   
  - Similar to what we saw in the crypt when we met Zac, but this is significantly larger  
    - This one appears to be a different color (red instead of yellow)  
    - Opening is big enough to see through \- can see a bright-orange/red landscape  
  - 2 Druids  
    - Furbolg in green robes  
    - Female halfling  
  - Riftcages \- this is a device that this crew has constructed out of soulwood which can be used to siphon energy from these anomalies which are rifts to other planes of existence. The devices need to be held in place long enough to reduce the size of the rift, but they cannot completely close it.   
  - Soulwood \- Rare type of wood \- Sacred and Magical \- infused with the essence of fallen druids \- happened a long time ago \- these druids were so desperate to save the world, that they infused their souls into the wood. Wood works as an insulator.   
  - Renneth:  
    - These are appearing throughout Exandria and many of the other planes of existence are not places we want Exandria connected to on a permanent basis  
    - Many other planes of existence are very evil or chaotic  
  - BACK AT THE CART: Human and Aarikocra talk to Popcorn and Laucian and explain that they are going in the same place as the rest of the party, and help Popcorn and Laucian hide the cart. Quorri (Aarikocra) & Lyraiel (Human) explain they have important items to deliver quickly (riftcages?)  
    - They share what they’re carrying and why they were hear \- to rededicate the shrine of Aurora's Descending  
    - Pulls out a ‘didgeridoo’ that they are going to use to help \- Didgeridoo made of Soulwood, probably  
  - Drawg & Hestarian hear a shrieking sound out of the rift.  
  - It’s flaming snakes.  
    - Three flaming snakes explode when they die.  
  - Rennith and her team have wooden cucumbers to throw in the rift. They’re rift cages.  
  - The crew kills something like 3-4 dragon snakes and a big red dragon thing (not metallic). Upon investigation, it is a “Hellfire Wyrmling” from the plane of fire.   
  - Drawing threw in a silver piece that hit the giant monster creature that almost made it through.  
  - Drawg skinned the wyrmling with a little help from Qilynn.  
    

# October 27, 2024 \- Longest “Funeral” Ever {#october-27,-2024---longest-“funeral”-ever}

        - The Ascendant \- Weird Druid Cult \- burned symbols (Qilynn Shared) potentially associated with them  
    - Coinpurse:  
      - 2 gp, 17 sp, and 31 cp \- Qilynn Takes it  
  - The crew continues up the hill  
    - Drawg does see spots of blood as they go \- like a seeping/dripping wound \- blood is cold and drying, but not dried   
    - Qilynn sees nothing ‘religious’ as they continue up the hill  
  - The path enters a more closed-in stand of trees that the party can no longer see into.   
  - Path is stony/rocky which appears to be intentional rocks in the path \- Really old road

    - Opening is big enough to see through  
    


# October 20, 2024 \- Hobby Horse {#october-20,-2024---hobby-horse}

The return begins.  
One night overnight, then rain starts  
Second night \- Qilynn catches Zak stealing a bell for Seraphina and we find out that they’ve been stealing our stuff.  
Turns out, Seraphina was using it to build an effigy for her patron. Her patron showed her a sign so we can move on.

# October 13, 2024 \- Is that a dwarf? {#october-13,-2024---is-that-a-dwarf?}

**4 Days In**

- Follow ‘snail’ or ‘slug’ trail to stairs.   
- Dwarf being eaten by a Lizard \- party attacks, but the creature seems intelligent enough to recognize language and not easily destroyed?   
  - Nacria steals Hesterian’s oatmeal creampie (that she also stole)...  
- Dechs (pronounced Dex) (Amanda Jeane) \- the Dwarf Beast-Master/Ranger and “Surge” the Marine Iguana  
  - Dechs was attacked by little fish with sharp teeth and the Lizard likely saved her?   
  - Dechs was there to hunt for special herbs and grasses \- found some but not all.  
    - Dechs Needs: 4 Plants \- already has two \- still needs subba and the fechy root

  - They are quickly saved.

- LONG REST \- Don’t forget the ashes 

  ## The Compass:  {#the-compass:}

The Stonefoot Compass is a beautifully crafted compass made from dark, weathered ironwood. The surface is engraved with intricate carvings of winding vines and ancient dwarven runes, some still faintly gilded with gold leaf. Beneath a clear, domed glass cover, a black steel needle shaped like a leaf points steadily north, set against an ivory face marked with runes instead of letters. A small moss agate glimmers at the needle's center.

A brass ring around the edge is engraved with precise notches for finer navigation, and a folding magnifying lens is attached to the side on a delicate hinge. On the back, a tarnished brass plate bears a maker’s mark—a foot carved from stone—and the faint inscription: "To find one’s path is to know one’s self."

The Stonefoot Compass’s needle is magically attuned to always point true north, regardless of environmental conditions or magnetic interference. This property allows its user to maintain an accurate heading even in magically distorted locations or under the influence of powerful illusions.

In addition, once per day, the bearer can cast \*one\* of the following spells:

Find the Path. Concentration is maintained as long as the compass is held by the caster. The caster must keep the compass on them at all times or concentration is dropped, the path is lost, and the spell ends. Handing the compass to another person or dropping it has the same effect as if the caster lost concentration on the spell. The caster does not need to make concentration checks as long as they hold the compass.

  ## Equipment/Items ID’d this Session {#equipment/items-id’d-this-session}

**Argh’yak Bow** \- Qilynn Weapon(Shortbow), Rare (Requires Attunement) 

- When the string on this magic shortbow is drawn, the goblinoid face decorating the bow comes to life, muttering curses and spitting insults in Goblin. When you hit a creature with an attack roll using this bow, the target takes an extra 1d6 piercing damage if it has dealt damage to you since the end of your last turn.   
- Witch’s Soul. This bow has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can expend its charges to cast one of the following spells (spell save DC 15): bane (1 charge), silence (2 charges), or bestow curse (3 charges).   
  - BANE: 1st-Level Enchantment  
    - Casting Time: 1 action  
    - Range: 30 feet  
    - Components: V, S, M (a drop of blood)  
    - Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute  
    - Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must make Charisma saving throws. Whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.  
    - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.  
  - SILENCE: 2nd-Level Illusion (ritual)  
    - Casting Time: 1 action  
    - Range: 120 feet  
    - Components: V, S  
    - Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes  
    - For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius s⁠phere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the s⁠phere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.  
  - BESTOW CURSE: 3rd-Level Necromancy  
    - Casting Time: 1 action  
    - Range: Touch  
    - Components: V, S  
    - Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute  
    - You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:  
    - Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.  
    - While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.  
    - While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.  
    - While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.  
    - A remove curse spell ends this effect. At the DM’s option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The DM has final say on such a curse’s effect.  
    - At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the durati⁠on is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the dura⁠tion is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled. Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a durat⁠ion that doesn’t require concentration.

**Bone Merchant’s Coin** \- Hestarian \- Wondrous Item, Uncommon

- You have advantage on death saving throws while carrying this magic coin. In addition, you can flip the coin as an action to send a magical ping to an undead creature with which you are familiar. The creature recognizes you as the sender if it knows you and becomes aware of your precise position.

**Within Lockbox:** Blue quartz, Garnet, Polished piece of amber with an insect inside, Tiny emerald, Paper pouch containing diamond dust

Laucian and Qilynn Homework 

# August 18th, 2024 \- Secret Meetings and Nobody Wants to Share {#august-18th,-2024---secret-meetings-and-nobody-wants-to-share}

Hestarian shares that she's discovered that her murder is not in jail, but another guy is in jail. Hestarian 'haunted' the old proprietress. She discovered her murderer, Corfal Weatherin, is in Zadash and living under another name. Corfal was her patron \- she tried to escape with another colleague/roommate/lover when Corfal tried to buy her. Corfal killed them both. Qilynn recognizes Corfal's name. Hesterian’s undisguised face could be dangerous \- *good idea to get out of town*. 

Qilynn shares her meeting w/ Yrene has lead her to hunt down Elodyr who is trying to cozy up to Aelorin. Hesterian recognizes his name and identifies Qilynn as part of “The Clasp.” 

The team debates what to do next. Drawg heads up to the Pudgy Pigeon bar and runs into the gnome artificer from the skyship. This gnome also knows about the Lore Stone or Erindor.  The gnome is part of the "Obsidian Echoforge." Aethor is the gnome's name.

He has a lead on a fifth shard \- Calderax. Aethor met with him. Calderax has asked for a favor in order to give Aethor information. He wants Aethor to get an item. 

See the Letter to Calderax in the notes. Aethor is paying the group to gather the Stonefoot Compass and has agreed to broker a deal that they may meet Calderax. 

Agreed upon deal: 3000 gold if done in 15 days, Drawg gets some artificer thing, Qilynn wants him to broker an introduction with Calderax. 

It will take 1 week to get to the marshes (**Othemoor Swamp)** and one week back. Aethor will pay for supplies and cover the cost of transportation. He is staying at the Pigeon as well.  Two ways to get there \- over just land or a ship and land. 

Party to buy 2 horses and a cart. Need to create a list of supplies. Should include healing potions (not overboard). \- It would take about 5 days in the horse and cart \- this gives us 2 day window of leeway. 

# July 14th, 2024 \- Obsidian Echoforge is my band’s name  {#july-14th,-2024---obsidian-echoforge-is-my-band’s-name}

Dwarf from temple tells group to investigate "Obsidian Echoforge" group to find out more about fey rifts happening throughout the land.

Bar keep at Pudgy Pigeon tells us to check out Celunor's Collection to find out info on the Obsidian Echoforge... it is run by a tall black haired  elf/human. Qilynn knows him. His name is Keldrick.... Keldrick sells expensive stuff. (Aka a pearl unicorn was 22,000 gold pieces) He wants to buy something off of Laucian. “Kelinor’s Collection” 

We went to a library to learn more about the Obsidian EchoForge group. After two hours of research we found out: This group was once known as The Seekers of Eryndor’s Echo. Eryndor had a prophecy that was carved on an obsidian disk.  The prophecy stated "The cosmic scale--Exandria's fate--wavers in day's decline, will it lean towards dawning hope, or night where stars align".(see handout). 

This disk was shattered at one point in history and parts of the disk were located all around Exandria. The group's purpose was to located the disk and put it back together.  They are also seeking ways to close the rifts.  4 shards have been found so far. The group is in a city not to far from Port Dalmali.

# June 23, 2024 \- Figured out something to get somewhere {#june-23,-2024---figured-out-something-to-get-somewhere}

Last time in Exandria we burnt a card in a cauldron with a crispy cat. A ghost ghoul of the cat, attacked us then slipped under the wall.... (more to come)

Message:

Our small feline friends,

Their wit most distinguished,

Pushed to great ends,

Their chances extinguished.

The crew discovers that they can burn the deck of cards, leaving a soot covered white cat who coughs up a key to the door.  The door opens to a chamber with a Ki'Nau mural/triptych.  The first panel depicts a panel of judges/jury, a second panel depicts four criminals about to be drowned in the ocean, the final panel depicts a number of people (presumably the victims of the criminals in the second panel) happy.  This connected to hall with four closed coffins with four Ki'Nau names:  Kaihoko, Tāwhiri, Rangimarie, and Whetū.  The hall gave way to a chamber in which evil ghoul kitty waited.  Sadly, Drawg had to return the kitty to the beyond (RIP Sootsprite), greatly upsetting Hesterian who had no means to tame the ghoul.

In the chamber beyond the four coffins, there is a platform and seven coffins.  On the platform is a book and a warhammer made of black stone.  Drawg used ritual to talk to the hammer and determine that it is evil AF and named Ciria.  The journal is the Journal of Solan Taku.  It mentions the evil hammer being rare artifact, mysterious whispers and shadows, crimes committed, and describing the events of the mural.

After agreeing to take the book and the hammer with them, they moved to the next chamber.  After opening the door, the group saw a golden light in the upcoming chamber and heard a whoosh in the previous hallway where the coffins were.  Ghouls emerged from the coffins, but the group dispatched them with some damage and temporary reductions to their strength. 

The group ended on entering the final chamber where the golden light appeared to be.  It appeared to be a rift or energy of some type that emanated from a hole in the floor.  A creature came through the rift, only Seraphina has observed one of its kind before.

# June 2, 2024 \- Hey \- I remember this place {#june-2,-2024---hey---i-remember-this-place}

- Drawg and Qilynn go to the Gilded Pearl where Qilynn almost kills Yrene. Yrene has a friend that is large like Drawg. Drawg and Qilynn get friend fish and hang. Qilynn to meet w/ Yrene next day at noon to discuss Elodir who may have actually betrayed her.  
- Hestarian goes to her old Whorehouse to find it has been turned into a community theater. Popcorn, Laucian, and Seraphina accompany her. The person who runs the show is still there and in charge. She reconnects w/ a Tiefling friend who she needs to meet the next day as well.
