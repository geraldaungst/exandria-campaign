Aasimar Warlock

## Seraphina's Origin
An origin story: The Aurora Polaris bathed the ancient forest in a dazzling purple hue. The sister planets aligned perfectly along the horizon, while the northern star shimmered brilliantly overhead. The night Hanna and Heathcliff welcomed their child into the world was alive with celestial wonder. After enduring years of misfortune, it felt as though their prayers had finally been heard by a benevolent force. They were bestowed with an angelic gift in the form of a beautiful baby girl whom they named Seraphina, bestowing her childhood with grace.

Seraphina, a gentle and serene young girl, spent her days in the Savalirwood surrounding her home. It was clear that she possessed a unique affinity for nature and had a profound connection with the woodland creatures. Her parents lovingly nurtured her gift, teaching her to respect and protect the natural world.

One fateful day, while her father was out hunting, he spotted a majestic white doe. Prepared to take aim with his bow, he was stunned to see his young daughter step in front of the deer, gently raising her palms forward. Seraphina urged her father to aim elsewhere, for this creature was one with the forest. Unbeknownst to her, at that moment, Seraphina had unknowingly captured the attention of a great bearded unicorn named Elowen. Elowen, a deity from a different realm, recognized her potential and became Seraphina's patron, endowing her with celestial powers. Under Elowen's guidance, Seraphina learned the ancient magic of the fey and mastered the arts of healing and protection. She became the guardian of the woods, entrusted with the safety of all its inhabitants. Yet, despite her efforts, she soon discovered that her task was not without challenges.

Many years passed, and a darkness began to consume the once thriving woods. The land withered and twisted under its malevolent presence. One morning, Seraphina uncovered a trail of blood through the glen, leading her to the shocking sight of her beloved white stag beheaded. The enchanted woods rapidly decayed, and the surviving animals sought refuge in distant lands. Seraphina's parents fell mysteriously ill, and eventually, her mother succumbed to her affliction. Devastated by grief, Seraphina made a solemn vow to seek out those responsible for bringing darkness to her home. She moved her father away, to a city far removed from the tainted woods, and dedicated herself to ensuring that the celestial light shone brightly in a world overshadowed by adversity. Guided by the blessings of her patron, she embarked on a quest for answers.

Seraphina did not know that the growing corruption had its source far away from her home beneath the city of [[Rupture of the Molaesmyr Fey Crossing|Molaesmyr]].
