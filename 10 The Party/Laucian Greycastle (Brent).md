Half-elf Artificer

[Complete backstory here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1StQr9ugDG3bcIWoWiQKI06LYoePyskOQqI3h6XKEII0/edit)

Homelands: [[Port Damali]]
Background: Guild Artisan

Laucian Greycastle was born in the city of [[Port Damali]]. Laucian found it easy to make friends while growing up, and he loved being around other people. He has 6 true siblings, and a younger (half)sister named [[Bethrynna Greycastle|Bethrynna]] who is an elf. Laucian never really liked her that much, but she adored him. She always wants to help Laucian out, unless it means injury or death to her. They have a friendly relationship for the most part. 

From a young age, Laucian was enamored with the craftsmanship of the armor that the highest members of the Crownsguard wore. As soon as he was able to, he joined the armorers, locksmiths, and finesmiths guild as an apprentice so that he could learn to make armor just like it, or even better. Over the next several decades, he became very good at creating spectacular looking armor that functioned exquisitely well. His hard work and dedication seemed to be paying off. An anonymous customer (*who will turn out to be none other than [[Aelorin Nightshade]]*) contacted him to purchase some armor for a great deal of money. However, when they arrived to collect their armor (*though it was in fact a proxy since [[Aelorin Nightshade|Aelorin]] wanted to remain anonymous*), Laucian realized that the person was with the Myriad and refused to sell his armor to them. His armor is now being stored within the guild until someone who is worthy will buy it.

Traits: I like to talk at length about my profession. I don't part with my money easily and will haggle tirelessly to get the best deal possible. 
Ideal: Everyone should be free to pursue his or her own livelihood.
Bond: I created a great work for someone, and then found them unworthy to receive it. I'm still looking for someone worthy.
Flaw: I'll do anything to get my hands on something rare or priceless. But what?

### Potential Grave Insults
“You're nothing but a shadow of disappointment cast by the setting sun of our family's pride. You've extinguished any flicker of respect that I once held for you, leaving only the cold darkness of betrayal in your wake."
"You're nothing but a festering wound on the soul of our family, a stain so foul that even the darkest corners of the abyss would turn you away in disgust."
"You're not just a disgrace to our bloodline, you're a stain on the honor of our ancestors. If they could see what you've become, they'd disown you from beyond the grave."

> Maybe this family member was going to go off and do something dumb, like join an evil gang or run off with a lover that is “in with the wrong crowd.”
> They could be a raging alcoholic or drug addict that refuses help and advice. Maybe they did something so terrible so that they could scratch that itch.

# Story Ideas
Sibling #2, #3 & #5 left for some reason, but Laucian isn’t entirely sure why. Maybe they knew something about their parents that the others didn’t.
