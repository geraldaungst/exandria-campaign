Dragonborn Cleric

[[Drawg Backstory]]

[Complete backstory here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kCYL-n-Ef8hgJOnDDW2yf36AA-WvBsK9O6JlzQ4Jdwk/edit)

In his true form, Drawg is one of the 7 ancient dragons chosen by Bahamut to be his personal protectors when he walks the material plane as the kindly wizard Fizban.  When Drawg accepted this great honor, he anticipated a more exciting adventure.  What he found instead was a life of tedious boredom.  After all, who or what could actually stand up to 7 ancient dragons?  Much less, who is picking fights with Bahamut or Fizban anyway?  Besides all this, Bahamut put himself behind the Divine Gate!  It has now been so long since the 7 have been truly needed they have more or less been forgotten. Even those who remember think the 7 are ALL gold dragons which really pisses Drawg off because there are actually 3 gold, 1 silver, 1 brass, 1 copper and himself, a bronze.

Drawg begged Bahamut for the chance to walk the material plane in a mortal form for a lifetime.  Bahamut agreed and even allowed his brass dragon protector, Elbrindorcindar “[[Elby Cinderdash (Brew)|Elby]] Cinderdash”, to come along with Drawg.  But, there was a catch.

Bahamut has always had a soft spot in his heart for unicorns.  He believes them to be the only magical creatures to rival dragons.  As such he respects a particular bearded unicorn Elowen ([[Seraphina Amaris (Vicki)|Seraphina]]’s patron according to Vickie) who is of considerable power.  Elowen, or at least one of her devotees, has run into some considerable trouble in Wildmount. The Platinum Father has sent these two help.  Knowing that Elowen would scoff at the need for help, he has done so in secret by simply arranging a chance meeting between them knowing that Drawg would not be able to refuse helping anyone.  

Before Drawg and [[Elby Cinderdash (Brew)|Elby]] were allowed to go on their adventure, Fizban/Bahamut said the following to both of them.

“While you may not be in my presence, you will remain in my service.  There are many in need there.  I expect you both to be of service to those in need.”

Has a complicated relationship with [[Dhazar Zarakas]].

So he buys a pair of nice tactical-style pants at an odd-ball military surplus shop run by a very old silver Dragonborn named [[Azel Brightful]] who loves to tell old war stories.  Drawg buys the pants from the old timer after listening for hours.  He even pays a little extra on the sly.  He stuffs the pants into his gear and forgets about them for a while until he needs them.  When he unrolls them, the scabbard is there.  But it was not there when he bought the pants.
