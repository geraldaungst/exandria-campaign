Cook on the skyship. Poisons the captain's food (and accidentally some of the other passengers as well.)

**Physical Description:**

- **Species:** Lagomor, a rabbit-like humanoid.
- **Fur:** Fluffy, white fur with patches of light brown on the ears and around the eyes.
- **Eyes:** Bright blue, always wide with curiosity.
- **Height:** About 3 feet tall.
- **Clothing:** Wears a patchwork chef's apron over a colorful tunic. The apron is adorned with various cooking utensils tucked into pockets.
- **Accessories:** A small, crooked chef's hat sits atop his head, slightly askew.

**Personality Characteristics:**

- **Eccentric and Silly:** Guzezzik has a penchant for talking to his ingredients as if they were alive, often giving them names and backstories before he cooks them.
- **Inventive Chef:** He's known for his wildly creative dishes that sometimes defy logic but are always delicious. His signature dish could be "Cloud Puffs", a dessert that looks like tiny clouds and tastes like different types of weather (sunny lemon, stormy chocolate, etc.).
- **Storyteller:** Loves to regale the crew and passengers with exaggerated tales of his culinary adventures, often involving mythical ingredients and fantastical creatures.
- **Kind-Hearted:** Despite his quirks, he's incredibly kind-hearted and always looking to cheer up anyone having a bad day with a special treat or a listening ear.
- **Adaptable:** Being a cook on a skyship, he's used to working in a kitchen that's constantly moving through the air. He's adept at balancing and cooking even in turbulent skies.

Guzezzik adds a touch of whimsy and warmth to the skyship, making the journey across Exandria's skies not just an adventure, but a culinary exploration as well.
