Berinon is the first officer of [[the Unshaken]], who has been bribed to help with the skyjacking. He has recruited one of the cooks as well.

He has short, wavy, brown hair and gray eyes. He has veiny brown skin. He stands 172cm (5'7") tall and has a lean build. He has a diamond-shaped, forgettable face with a very short sideburns. He gestures profusely during a conversation.

Berinon is missing the middle finger of his right hand. Any time someone asks him about it, he makes up a wild (and entirely fictional) story about how it was lost. (The true story is that he was trying to open a stuck pickle jar lid. The jar broke, severing his finger. He now gets pale at the sight or the mention of pickles.)

## Personality Traits

He is very selfish. He is very courageous, to a fault. He always carries food in his pockets. He knows all the gossip around [[Port Damali]].

Catchphrases:

"If it were easy, they wouldn't need us."
"Do it right, or do it twice."
"A stormy sky makes a seasoned sailor, but calm winds wouldn't hurt."

## After the Hijacking
Berinon was frustrated with the pace of his career. He felt he would be a skyship captain by now, and when Thyakas "jumped over" him a year ago, his simmering resentment festered. When he was approached by Georgina with an opportunity to make a large amount of money and potentially become ship captain, he hesitated, but ultimately agreed to participate. He truly is a mercenary in this operation and knows nothing of the Emissaries or the motives for the skyjacking. He regrets his role and is willing to cooperate (to a point--he will also seek to manipulate the best possible outcome for himself), but has little information of use to the party. Berinon is the one who suggested recruiting Guzzezzik, but he did not approach the cook directly.
