Brelia Solvorn is the embodiment of steadfast resilience and unwavering loyalty, qualities that have cemented her role as both the ship's medic and navigator. At forty years old, she carries herself with an air of quiet confidence, her years aboard the skyship etching both wisdom and warmth into her demeanor. Brelia's relationship with the captain, a female tiefling with whom she shares much more than just a cabin, is a testament to her capacity for deep, platonic bonds. Despite the whispers and rumors that swirl among the crew, their connection transcends mere companionship, rooted in a shared history and mutual respect that mirrors the closeness of siblings. Her approach to life is pragmatic yet compassionate, guiding the crew through the skies with a steady hand and healing their wounds with a gentle touch. Brelia's strength lies not just in her navigational or medical skills, but in her ability to be the emotional anchor for the crew, offering a listening ear and sage advice with equal ease. Her laughter is a rare but cherished melody that lightens the air, reminding all who hear it of the warmth and joy that can be found even in the vast, unforgiving skies.

Brelia Solvorn carries the grace of the seas and the resolve of the skies in her posture, standing at a modest height with an unassuming strength that belies her years of service aboard the skyship. Her skin is weathered yet radiant, bearing the marks of countless sunrises and storms faced head-on, a testament to her life spent navigating the elements. Her hair, once a vibrant chestnut, now shows strands of silver, each one a badge of experience and wisdom, usually pulled back into a practical bun to keep it out of her way during her duties. Her eyes, a deep hazel, are like calm harbors, reflecting a depth of knowledge and kindness, yet sharp and alert, missing nothing that happens on her ship. Her hands are steady and skilled, marked with small scars and calluses from years of medical procedures and handling navigation instruments, each one telling a story of emergencies weathered and lives saved. Brelia's attire is a blend of functionality and personal style, favoring durable fabrics that allow freedom of movement, with a navigator's sextant hanging from a chain around her neck, a symbol of her role and a tool of her trade. Despite the wear of time, she moves with a purposeful grace, embodying the spirit of adventure and the resilience of those who call the sky their home.
