![[grendar-goss.jpeg|right|300]]
Grendar is a firbolg, almost 8 feet tall, with light gray skin and thick, dark blue fur. He has a cowlike body with sloping shoulders, floppy, pointed ears and a broad, pink nose. He is bipedal and has large but delicate hands that are excellent at handling bottles and bar utensils.

His tall silhouette is draped in garments of extraordinary quality. His tunic, woven from the finest silks that carry the lustrous sheen of forest dews under the morning sun, flows over his frame in shades of earth and leaf. These fabrics, costly and rare, are kept immaculately clean, reflecting Grendar's respect for himself and his patrons.

The leather of his apron, soft yet durable, is of the highest craftsmanship, dyed in deep greens and browns that harmonize with the natural palette of his attire. Its pockets, precision-stitched, are home to his botanical tools and vials, their organization speaking to a mind that values order as much as beauty. The wooden charm around his neck, polished to a warm glow, serves as a testament not only to his connection with nature but also to the artistry that pervades every aspect of his life.

Behind the bar, Grendar's sanctuary within the skyship, every bottle and ingredient is arranged with deliberate care, standing against a backdrop of polished wood that mirrors the bar's own pristine condition. Interspersed among these are his cherished plants, each housed in containers of fine ceramics or glass, their lushness indicative of his unwavering dedication. These plants, brought from every corner of Exandria, are not mere decorations but beloved companions, their vitality a reflection of Grendar's own spirit.

Grendar keeps the following plants at his bar in a kind of herb garden. He uses these often in creating interesting and unique drinks for his guests:

1. **Whispering Ferns from the Savalirwood**
    
    - **Origin:** Savalirwood, Greying Wildlands.
    - **Reason for Addition:** Grendar picked these ferns from the mystical heart of the Savalirwood, where the whispers of ancient spirits guide the unwary. He added them to his bar to infuse his cocktails with the wood's mysterious energies, offering guests a taste of the arcane.
2. **Everbloom Lilies from the Ashkeeper Peaks**
    
    - **Origin:** The slopes of the Ashkeeper Peaks.
    - **Reason for Addition:** These rare lilies, which bloom eternally in the harsh, cold climate of the Ashkeeper Peaks, were added by Grendar for their resilience and beauty. They symbolize the enduring nature of hope amidst adversity.
3. **Duskthorn Berries from the Umbra Hills**
    
    - **Origin:** The shadowed valleys of the Umbra Hills.
    - **Reason for Addition:** Grendar was drawn to the Duskthorn berries for their unique ability to thrive in darkness. He uses these berries to craft cocktails that capture the essence of night, offering a taste of the tranquil darkness that envelops the Umbra Hills at twilight.
4. **Sunfire Caps from the Menagerie Coast**
    
    - **Origin:** The vibrant forests near the Menagerie Coast.
    - **Reason for Addition:** These bright, spicy mushrooms were collected from the underbrush of the forests lining the Menagerie Coast. Grendar chose them for their fiery flavor, adding a touch of warmth and excitement to his drinks.
5. **Galeleaf Mint from the Howling Chasm**
    
    - **Origin:** The wind-swept cliffs surrounding the Howling Chasm.
    - **Reason for Addition:** This rare mint, which tastes of fresh, cool winds and carries a slight electrical charge, was added to create invigorating drinks that mimic the exhilarating rush of standing at the chasm's edge amidst the relentless gales.
6. **Moonshadow Vines from the Shattered Teeth**
    
    - **Origin:** The elusive islands of the Shattered Teeth.
    - **Reason for Addition:** Grendar ventured to the Shattered Teeth to procure these vines, which bloom only under moonlight, casting an ethereal glow. They add a mystical, luminescent quality to his cocktails, embodying the enchantment of moonlit nights.
7. **Starpepper Seeds from Wildemount**
    
    - **Origin:** The exotic markets of [[Zadash]], Wildemount.
    - **Reason for Addition:** Acquired in the bustling markets of [[Zadash]], these seeds produce peppers that burst with a flavor both spicy and reminiscent of distant stars. Grendar uses them to add a celestial spark to his creations, inspired by the vastness of the cosmos.
8. **Frostleaf from the Cyrios Mountains**
    
    - **Origin:** The icy peaks of the Cyrios Mountains.
    - **Reason for Addition:** Frostleaf, known for its ability to cool a drink instantly upon contact, was added by Grendar for its magical properties. It symbolizes the beauty and peril of the Cyrios Mountains, offering patrons a chilling, refreshing experience reminiscent of the mountains' frigid gusts.
