Attire: She dons an elegant, brightly colored coat with nautical motifs sewn into the cuffs, and wears sturdy boots fit for skyship decking.
Personality: Thyakas is charismatic and insightful, often surprising her crew with her keen understanding of people and situations. She approaches her role with a mix of eagerness and curiosity, aware of her limitations but willing to learn. She often has a broad smile on her face and is friendly with almost everyone.
