Dwarf Artificer

Gaius Emberfell is a master artificer and the leading mind behind the device meant to disperse the arcane energy of the rifts. Once an esteemed engineer for the city of Hupperdook, his life changed when he lost his family to a magical disaster, which redirected his expertise towards the containment and control of arcane forces. His fervent belief in the [[Obsidian Echoforge]]'s cause is as much to save others from his fate as it is to quell his own guilt.
