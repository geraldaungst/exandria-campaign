# Core Information
Aethor Kalisk's Workshop
Nestled in a quiet corner of the Obsidian Echoforge's research wing, Aethor's workshop is a carefully organized chaos of arcane implements and research materials. While it might appear cluttered to outsiders, everything has its place in his methodical system.

Workshop Layout:
- Main Workbench: Covered in current projects and precision tools
- Component Storage: Wall-mounted shelves with labeled containers
- Research Area: Desk piled with scrolls and reference materials
- Testing Station: Heavily warded area for device calibration
- Materials Processing: Small forge and crystal grinding station
- Safety Station: Emergency containment measures and protective gear

Security Measures:
- Arcane locks on all entrances
- Protective wards against scrying and theft
- Automated alert system for unauthorized entry
- Secure storage for sensitive materials and research notes

The workshop serves as both Aethor's sanctuary and his primary research facility. Every surface shows signs of ongoing work: half-assembled devices, careful notes, and projects in various stages of completion. Despite the apparent disorder, he maintains strict protocols for safety and security, particularly regarding his work with Lorestone-related artifacts.

Notable Features:
- Enhanced ventilation system for working with volatile components
- Specialized lighting for detailed work
- Reinforced floors to support heavy equipment
- Built-in surge protection for arcane experiments
