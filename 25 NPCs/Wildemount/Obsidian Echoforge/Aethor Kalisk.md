Passenger on the Skyship. A gnome artificer and key researcher of the [[Obsidian Echoforge]], known for his work on arcane refraction. Target of [[Valen Elderguard]]'s plot to skyjack the ship. Has a lead on someone in [[Port Damali]] ([[Calderax Dunhall]]) who may have information about a missing Lorestone Shard. He plans to meet with Calderax when he arrives in the city.

**Background and Origin**: Aethor is a key researcher for the [[Obsidian Echoforge]], a group dedicated to locating all fragments of the powerful and prophetic [[Lorestone of Eryndor]]. His involvement with the group was born out of necessity; after inadvertently saving an [[Obsidian Echoforge|Echoforge]] member with his arcane refraction technique, he was persistently recruited for his unique skills. Despite his initial reluctance, his dedication to his mission and the potential for monumental impact drove him to join.

**Personality**: Aethor is highly dextrous, detail-oriented, and not much of a risk-taker. He prefers compiling facts and reasoning out solutions, often taking his time to ensure accuracy. However, once he believes he has all the necessary data, his dedication turns almost reckless as he pursues his goals with an intensity that doesn't wait for others to keep up. Despite his occasional stubbornness, he's driven by a genuine desire to restore balance and prevent chaos. He exhibits a quiet curiosity and a gentle wisdom that comes from years of study and experience.

**Appearance** (Elderly Careful Scholar): Aethor has soft, rounded, and pudgy features marked by the lines of concentration and age. His bright blue eyes, framed by deep laugh lines, reflect a lifetime of intellectual pursuit and curiosity. His fair skin shows the rosy tinge of one who has spent much time poring over tomes and artifacts. He dresses in a finely woven, aged cloak over a tunic with an intricate design, paired with simple trousers and soft, worn leather shoes. Around his neck, he carries an old satchel filled with scrolls and tomes, and on his finger, he wears a simple silver ring engraved with arcane symbols for protection. His typical expression is one of quiet curiosity, with a gentle, wise smile.

**Skills and Abilities**: A skilled stoneworker and agile fighter, Aethor is best known for his work on arcane refraction, a method he believes can help locate and assemble the Lorestone fragments. He has devised a device that refracts arcane energies, specifically designed for the task of stabilizing and closing planar rifts that threaten Exandria.

**Arcane Refraction - Revised Resonance Tuning (Planar Harmonics Alignment)**: This device aligns the chaotic energies of the planar rifts with the order inherent in the Lorestone fragments, using prismatic and temporal elements to locate and properly assemble the scattered pieces. It's a sophisticated mechanism that requires rare and bespoke components, including the Arcanist's Prism, a powerful tool originally crafted by mages from the Age of Arcanum to safely harness ley line powers.

**Components for Arcane Device**: Aethor's notes detail the various components needed for his device, ranging from common parts like copper wiring and quartz crystals to rare materials like enchanted electrum filament and star iron. The most critical items are bespoke components such as the Ethereum Core and the Arcanist's Prism, each requiring a quest or significant effort to acquire.

**Present Life**: As the older, careful scholar, Aethor's life revolves around his cluttered, secure workshop filled with projects at various stages of completion. His days are consumed by research, experimentation, and the occasional fieldwork necessary to gather the components for his device. While he's driven by his quest and the potential impact of his work, he maintains a cautious approach to his experiments and adventures, always mindful of the risks and implications of his actions.
