Aethor's primary research focuses on arcane refraction, a method for locating and assembling Lorestone fragments. His device uses prismatic and temporal elements to align chaotic energies with the order inherent in the fragments.

# Source Context
Aethor believes the [[Arcanist's Prism]] can help with his research. This artifact does not exist, however, and the one he is seeking is a forgery.
