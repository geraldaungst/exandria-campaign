# Core Information
The device is a sophisticated mechanism that requires rare and bespoke components for the proper refraction and alignment of arcane energies. At its core lies the Arcanist's Prism, an artifact from the Age of Arcanum originally crafted to safely harness ley line powers.

Required Components:
- [[Arcanist's Prism]] (core component)
- Ethereum Core for power regulation
- Enchanted electrum filament for energy conduction
- Star iron framework for stability
- Copper wiring for basic connections
- Quartz crystals for energy focusing
- Various specialized tools for maintenance and calibration

The device works by aligning chaotic energies from planar rifts with the inherent order of Lorestone fragments. Through careful prismatic and temporal adjustments, it can theoretically locate and help properly assemble the scattered pieces of the Lorestone.

Current Status: Functional but requiring regular maintenance and occasional component replacement. Some components, particularly the electrum filament, degrade with extended use.

Safety Protocols:
- Must be operated in a controlled environment
- Requires proper grounding to prevent arcane feedback
- Should not be used near unstable magical fields
- Regular calibration necessary to maintain accuracy
