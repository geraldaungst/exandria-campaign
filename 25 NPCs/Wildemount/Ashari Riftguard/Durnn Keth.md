![[durnn.png|right|300]]

- **Tribe:** Terrah (Earth Ashari)
- **Race:** Goliath
- **Class:** Monk (Way of the Four Elements)

Durnn's imposing stature is a striking contrast to his gentle nature. He sees the earth as a source of strength and stability, and through his monastic training, he channels the elemental power of the earth. His seismic senses are fine-tuned, allowing him to feel disturbances in the leylines, which often precede the opening of a rift. In combat, he is an immovable force who can also manipulate the earth to entrap and hinder enemies.
