Sylphia is a gifted druid with an intrinsic connection to the skies and weather patterns. Her ability to forecast and manipulate the weather has made her an invaluable asset to the Zephrah tribe. She joined the [[Ashari Riftguard|Riftguard]] to study the atmospheric anomalies caused by the rifts and uses her abilities to navigate and manipulate air currents, which is crucial when dealing with rifts that affect the skies or weather systems.
