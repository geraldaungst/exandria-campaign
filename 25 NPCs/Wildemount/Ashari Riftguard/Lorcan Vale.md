![[lorcan.png|right|300]]

- **Tribe:** Pyrah (Fire Ashari)
- **Race:** Tiefling
- **Class:** Sorcerer (Wild Magic)

Lorcan is a vibrant spirit with a fiery heart, fitting for their tribe. Their innate tiefling magic was further ignited by the Wild Magic of the Fire Plane's influence. They wield fire with a creativity and passion that is both awe-inspiring and terrifying. Lorcan has a personal stake in preventing the rifts; a wild surge once tore their family apart, and they seek to understand and control the chaotic magic that defines them.
