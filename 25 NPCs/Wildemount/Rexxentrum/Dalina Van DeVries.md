![[dalina-van-devries.png|right|300]]Skin Color: Dusky grey with a hint of green

Hair Color and Style: Dark brown, left loose and wild, cascading over her shoulders. She often pushes it back with a leather headband.

Style of Dress: Dalina prefers a blend of noble elegance and comfort, often seen in a dark green tunic with gold embroidery, paired with fitted trousers and sturdy boots. Her sleeves are rolled up to the elbows, showing her readiness to work. She always wears a pair of round, wire-framed spectacles perched on her nose.

Significant Item: A silver ring set with a moonstone, which she fidgets with whenever she laughs to herself. This ring was a gift from her former lover, making it a source of both comfort and sorrow for her.

She greets most guests with, "Come in, come in! If you have a story to tell, a spell to enscribe, or perhaps a lover to woo, I have the perfect parchment for the task. Now what can I help you write today?"

She typically calls after her guests as they leave, saying "May your ink never smudge and your quill never dull!"

## History
Growing up among the elite of Rexxentrum, Dalina Van DeVries was fascinated by the magical artifacts and ancient scrolls her family collected. She was accepted to the prestigious Solstryce Academy, where she initially pursued studies in spellcasting. However, Dalina soon realized her true passion lay in the craft of writing and inscribing, not in casting spells. She made the difficult decision to drop out, but left on good terms, maintaining powerful connections with the faculty. Using her refined skills and noble heritage, Dalina opened The Ink & Quill Emporium, where she offers the finest enchanted quills and parchments. Her shop quickly became famous among nobles and wizards alike, blending her noble upbringing with her artisanal talents.
