Archivist at the Rexxentrum Archive of the [[Cobalt Soul]]. A nonbinary half-elf (they/them) with short pink hair with a rat tail. They have a dry and sarcastic sense of humor. They have a neurological disorder that makes them excel at details, but also causes frequent insomnia. They have an eidetic memory. They work slowly and methodically, but are incredibly persistent and thorough. They are used to getting what they want, usually through relentless planning and preparation.

Ovedo is a distinctive figure within the hallowed halls of the Rexxentrum Archive of the Cobalt Soul, a repository of knowledge in the world of Exandria. As a nonbinary half-elf, they possess a unique blend of elven grace and human resilience, marked by their striking short pink hair that stands out against their pale, almost luminescent skin—a deliberate contrast to the more traditional hues found among their kin. The rat tail, a slender braid that trails behind, adds a touch of rebelliousness to their appearance, hinting at a personality that refuses to conform to the expected norms of either their elven or human heritage.

Ovedo's eyes, a vivid shade of green, are often seen flickering with a spark of mischief or narrowing in concentration as they delve into the mysteries of ancient texts. These eyes, combined with a face that carries an almost perpetual expression of thoughtful analysis or wry amusement, make them a memorable presence. Their body is lean and wiry, a testament to the countless hours spent navigating the vast expanse of the archive rather than physical prowess, giving them a somewhat scholarly yet resilient appearance.

Personality-wise, Ovedo is a complex tapestry of contradictions. Their dry and sarcastic humor often serves as a shield, protecting them from the world's harshness while allowing them to navigate its complexities with a sharp wit. This humor, however, never quite masks the deep-seated passion they harbor for their work as an Archivist—a role they approach with a methodical and persistent dedication that is as much a part of them as their very breath.

The neurological disorder that graces Ovedo with an exceptional attention to detail and an eidetic memory also curses them with frequent bouts of insomnia. This affliction, while troublesome, has molded them into a creature of the night, where the quiet solitude of the archive becomes a sanctuary for their tireless mind. It is in these still hours that Ovedo truly thrives, their ability to absorb and recall information with astonishing accuracy making them an invaluable asset to the Cobalt Soul.

Despite their slow and meticulous work pace, Ovedo is driven by an iron will and a determination that borders on stubbornness. Their approach to problem-solving involves relentless planning and preparation, a strategy that has consistently enabled them to achieve their goals, often to the surprise of those who underestimate them. This tenacity, combined with their adeptness at leveraging their unique skills and knowledge, ensures that Ovedo is a force to be reckoned with, both within the archive and beyond.

In social situations, Ovedo maintains a polite, if somewhat reserved, demeanor. They are fiercely independent and are used to relying on their own capabilities to navigate the challenges that life presents. However, beneath the surface, there exists a deep capacity for loyalty and a willingness to go to great lengths for those they consider friends or allies.

Ovedo's unique blend of attributes—physical, mental, and emotional—makes them a multifaceted character, one whose journey through the world of Exandria is bound to be as rich and varied as the tomes that line the shelves of the Rexxentrum Archive of the Cobalt Soul.
