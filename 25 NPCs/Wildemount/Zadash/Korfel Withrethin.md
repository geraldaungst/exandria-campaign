# Current Situation

Currently operates as a major [[Myriad]] crime boss in [[Zadash]] under the alias "Babenon Dosal." Runs operations from the Evening Nip tavern and has built a sophisticated criminal network over 2-3 years. Unknown to his organization, he is actually Korfel Withrethin, a murderer who fled [[Port Damali]] after committing the [[Port Damali Murders]].

**Current Resources:**

- Forged [[Arcanist's Prism]] (significant magical artifact)

- Substantial financial resources and corrupt official connections
- [[Blood Sample Collection Protocol]] for controlling associates

# Background

## Origins in Port Damali

Korfel Withrethin was a merchant in [[Port Damali]] with criminal connections who had purchased exclusive patronage of [[Hesterian Shyr (Dot)]] from [[Grisul Adder]]'s brothel. When he discovered Hesterian planned to escape with her lover [[Xanaphia Lothliss]], his obsession with control led to violence.
