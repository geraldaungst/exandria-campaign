[[Hesterian Shyr (Dot)|Hesterian]]'s former patron and the one who murdered her.

After the murder, Korfel gave a tip to the authorities leading them to the [[Rylan Estevez|stable boy]] as the murderer. He was found with the bloody knife that killed [[Hesterian Shyr (Dot)|Hesterian]], and is now in prison serving a 10 year sentence.

Korfel then fled to [[Zadash]], where he set himself up as a merchant and Myriad crime boss known as "The Gentleman". He now goes by the name "Babenon Dosal" to those who he most trusts. No one in [[Zadash]] knows about his former life in [[Port Damali]] as Korfel.

Currently holds the (forged) [[Arcanist's Prism]].
