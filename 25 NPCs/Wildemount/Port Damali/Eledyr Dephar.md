## Roleplay

- **Voice:** Smooth and calculating, speaks with measured precision. Uses academic terminology when in cover identity, shifts to street cant when in Clasp mode
- **Mannerisms:**
    - Unconsciously touches his silver dagger when feeling threatened or challenged
    - Takes detailed mental notes of everyone he meets, cataloging potential usefulness
    - Maintains different postures for different identities (scholarly stoop vs. confident operative stance)
- **Notable Traits:**
    - **Personality:** Cunning, ambitious, and harbors deep-seated grudges. Calculating nature makes him appear cold and aloof
    - **Intelligence:** Highly intelligent and observant, with a knack for uncovering secrets and using them to his advantage
    - Exceptional memory for grudges and perceived slights
    - Compartmentalizes loyalties - can genuinely serve multiple masters simultaneously

# Current Situation

Currently operating dual identities in Rexxentrum. As an academic researcher, he frequents the Scroll and Scribe and various libraries investigating prophecy-related inquiries. As an Emissary operative, he meets with [[Valen Elderguard]] at the secret townhouse to plan operations against rival factions. Recently arrived to begin comprehensive intelligence gathering on the sudden interest in ancient prophecies, with particular focus on tracking [[Obsidian Echoforge]] activities and identifying other competing factions.

# Background

Eledyr Dephar was born to a human mother and an elven father, growing up amidst the complexity of both human and elven cultures. He always felt a sense of alienation, never fully belonging to either world. This feeling of being an outsider drove him to the shadows of society, where he found a sense of belonging within the Clasp under [[Aelorin Nightshade]]'s mentorship.

**Key Events:**

- **Training Mission Humiliation:** [[Qilynn Duskwhisper (Nicole)|Qilynn]]'s casual criticism of his stealth skills created lasting resentment
- **Successful Sabotage:** Orchestrated Qilynn's mission failure through careful manipulation of security arrangements
- **Emissary Recruitment:** [[Valen Elderguard]] identified and recruited him using his Clasp connections
- **Current Assignment:** Tasked with investigating sudden interest in ancient prophecy research
