[[Qilynn Duskwhisper (Nicole)|Qilynn]]'s mentor and trainer.

Aelorin was an orphan who grew up in the Driftwood Asylum. While there, he was often sent on "missions" by the cruel headmaster, Grankton. Eventually, he grew tired of the life there, and as a teenager he left on a mission and never returned. Grankton assumed he had died and never looked into it.

Aelorin struggled to survive on his own until he connected with members of the Myriad who found his magical skills useful. As he established himself in the organization, he worked his way up, gaining status and wealth, and as a result, the attention of the Clasp and local rival gangs.

Aelorin recently got word of a rare and ancient relic and sent his new mentee, [[Calderax Dunhall]] to pick it up. Calderax found out that it was a Shard of the Lorestone and immediately notified his contacts in the Obsidian Echoforge who sent [[Aethor Kalisk]] to get it. Aethor will be meeting Calderax in [[Port Damali]].
