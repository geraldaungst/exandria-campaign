> You see a wiry young man, around 18, with olive-toned skin that has paled in patches, giving him a sickly look. His deep-set green eyes, dulled with bitterness and hopelessness, peer out from behind a tousled mass of dark brown curls. Dressed in the rough-spun clothes of a prisoner, his frame is gaunt, and he moves slowly, as if conserving energy. Around his wrist is a small, worn leather bracelet, cracked and stained with ageâ€”a relic of a life left behind. He absently twists the bracelet, revealing calloused skin beneath, a sign of his long imprisonment.

Rylan is the stable boy who was (falsely) accused by [[Korfel Withrethin]] of Hesterian's murder before he left.

Rylan was quickly convicted on the strength of the false lead and planted evidence, and is currently serving a 10-year sentence in prison.

Rylan has no information about the crime or how he got tied up in it, other than the name of his accuser.

Rylan wears a leather bracelet on his left wrist. The bracelet was a gift to him from Xanaphia:

> You see a simple yet finely crafted leather bracelet, its dark brown band smooth and worn from frequent handling. Etched into the surface is a delicate crescent moon symbol, its ends curving gracefully upwards to form a protective arch. Inside the curve of the crescent, the initials "XL" are embossed in elegant script, subtly blending into the design. The bracelet shows signs of age, with small cracks and a soft patina, suggesting it has been cherished and frequently handled.
