### Week 3-4: Active Surveillance

- [ ] **Monitor Obsidian Echoforge communications** (ongoing)
    - Intercept correspondence with field agents
    - Track Lyren Willowwhisper's movements
- [ ] **Investigate Assembly "Draconian expedition" plans** (5-7 days)

    - Propose direct intervention scenarios
    - Request authorization for field deployment

**ðŸ“‹ Knowledge Gained:**  (add to [[What Eledyr Knows]])

- **Assembly is planning a major expedition to Draconian ruins within 6 weeks** - seeking pre-Calamity artifacts and additional prophecy fragments
- **The party has acquired significant artifacts/knowledge** - Assembly and Echoforge communications reference "new players with important acquisitions"

## **MONTH 3: Active Operations Phase**

_Flexible location based on campaign needs_

### Week 1-2: Pre-Deployment

- [ ] **Final intelligence synthesis** (2-3 days)
    - Compile comprehensive faction assessment
    - Identify highest-priority intervention targets
- [ ] **Prepare for field operations** (3-5 days)
    - Finalize equipment and personnel
    - Establish communication protocols with Valen
- [ ] **Deploy to primary target area** (timing flexible)
    - Options: Draconian ruins, Palma Flora, Rift locations, Party intercept

**ðŸ“‹ Knowledge Gained:**  (add to [[What Eledyr Knows]])

- **Lorestone assembly requires a Luxon Beacon in addition to the shards** - explains why no faction has succeeded yet despite finding fragments
- **The party's current location and likely next destinations** - intercepted communications reveal their general whereabouts and mission goals

### Week 3-4: Field Activities (Location Dependent)

- [ ] **Option A: Draconian Ruins Expedition**
    
    - Infiltrate/monitor Assembly archaeological operations
    - Search for additional prophecy fragments
    - Sabotage competitor efforts if opportunity arises
- [ ] **Option B: Obsidian Echoforge Facility Infiltration**
    
    - Penetrate Palma Flora or other Echoforge stronghold
    - Steal/copy Lorestone research
    - Plant surveillance assets
- [ ] **Option C: Party Intercept Mission**
    
    - Track party's activities and acquisitions
    - Determine what artifacts/knowledge they possess
    - Coordinate with Dreyara Drimvar if paths cross

**ðŸ“‹ Knowledge Gained (varies by chosen option):**  (add to [[What Eledyr Knows]])

- **Option A:** Location of additional prophecy shards hidden in Draconian ruins + Assembly's true timeline (much faster than expected)
- **Option B:** Complete Echoforge research data + discovery that they're closer to success than any other faction
- **Option C:** Detailed inventory of party's capabilities and artifacts + confirmation of their alliance with specific factions

## **ONGOING ACTIVITIES** _(Throughout all 3 months)_

- [ ] **Weekly reports to Valen Elderguard**
- [ ] **Maintain academic cover identity**
- [ ] **Monitor Clasp inquiries about personal activities**
- [ ] **Track Qilynn/Yrene investigation progress**
- [ ] **Update prophecy interpretation research**

## **CONTINGENCY TRIGGERS** _(Adjust timeline if these occur)_

- [ ] **If party returns to Rexxentrum early**: Accelerate to field deployment
- [ ] **If Echoforge makes major breakthrough**: Emergency intervention mode
- [ ] **If personal exposure risk increases**: Withdraw to deep cover/relocate
- [ ] **If Assembly deploys first**: Counter-operation immediate deployment
- [ ] **If Valen needs immediate asset**: Drop current activities for priority mission

## **INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTS** _(What he discovers along the way)_

- [ ] **Four-faction conflict map** - Who wants what and why
- [ ] **Prophecy timeline assessment** - How close each faction is to success
- [ ] **Assembly's true intentions** - Control/weaponize rifts rather than close them
- [ ] **Lorestone assembly requirements** - What's still needed beyond shards
- [ ] **Vulnerable operation windows** - When/where to strike competitors

## **POTENTIAL DISCOVERY CLUES** _(For party to find)_

- Research notes in academic institutions
- Black market dealer testimonies about "well-funded buyer"
- Travel document applications for border regions
- Equipment purchases suggesting field preparation
- Academic social circle gossip about "suspicious scholar"
- Intercepted communications with coded Emissary terminology
