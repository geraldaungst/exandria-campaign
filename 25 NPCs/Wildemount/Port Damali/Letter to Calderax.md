Dear Friend of [[Calderax Dunhall|Calderax]],

It seems we have a shared interest in an ancient artifact, one that has come to my attention through a trusted intermediary. As the lead of the Port Zoon Cartographers Guild, I do indeed hold information about this item.

In addition to the agreed-upon payment, there is a personal favor I must ask. I am in need of a specific item rumored to have been lost in the Othemoor Marshâ€”a family heirloom of great significance. The item in question is the [[Stonefoot Compass]], crafted by my ancestor, Brom Stonefoot.

The compass was lost during an ill-fated expedition led by Brom himself decades ago. His party was ambushed by creatures of the marsh, and the compass was thought to be lost in the ensuing chaos. Despite its importance, neither I nor any member of my family has been able to retrieve it. The marsh is perilous and treacherous, and numerous attempts have ended in failure or tragedy. As the head of the guild and primary teacher, my responsibilities have kept me from undertaking such a dangerous journey myself.

However, recent events have made the compass potentially accessible again. Weeks of unending rainfall last year, followed by a significant drought, have shifted the landscape of the marsh according to reports from the area. I suspect that the chances of finding the lost compass are better now than they have ever been.

The only survivor of Brom's expedition mentioned a cluster of twisted willow trees, whose roots form a natural alcove. We believe this was most likely Brom's resting place when he succumbed to the swamp, and the best place to begin searching for the compass.

If you can retrieve this compass for me, I would be more than willing to part with the artifact you seek. Let us arrange the details through Calderax, ensuring we both remain safe and secure in this transaction. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Warm regards,

[[Keldar Stonefoot]]
