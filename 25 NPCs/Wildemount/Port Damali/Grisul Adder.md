**Bonus Actions**

**Intimidating Glare:** Grisul targets one creature she can see within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.

The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if Grisul is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success.
