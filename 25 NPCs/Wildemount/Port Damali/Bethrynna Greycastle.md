![[bethrynna.png|right|300]]
Half-sister of [[Laucian Greycastle (Brent)|Laucian Greycastle]].

Bethrynna's features closely resemble [[Laucian Greycastle (Brent)|Laucian]]'s, with brownish-gray skin (though lighter than [[Laucian Greycastle (Brent)|Laucian]]'s) and black hair. She has flawless skin, soft facial features, and striking green eyes. Standing at 5'7" and with a slender build, she moves with a grace that's almost ethereal. Bethrynnaâ€™s black hair is loosely tied back, with a few braids intertwined with small, self-made metal charms.. Her green eyes appear even more striking against the natural backdrop. She is dressed in a leather tunic and pants, suited for movement through the woods. A cloak with a hood, embroidered with abstract leaf-like patterns, drapes her shoulders.

Like [[Laucian Greycastle (Brent)|Laucian]], Bethrynna has a talent for craftsmanship, but her focus is on jewelry making and fine metalwork. She is meticulous and patient, with an eye for detail. She shares a friendly rivalry with her brother, always striving to create pieces that rival his armor in beauty and craftsmanship.
