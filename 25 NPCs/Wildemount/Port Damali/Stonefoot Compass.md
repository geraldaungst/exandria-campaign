![[Stonefoot Compass.jpeg]]

As you unearth the object from the muck, you reveal a beautifully crafted compass made from dark, weathered ironwood. The surface is engraved with intricate carvings of winding vines and ancient dwarven runes, some still faintly gilded with gold leaf. Beneath a clear, domed glass cover, a black steel needle shaped like a leaf points steadily north, set against an ivory face marked with runes instead of letters. A small moss agate glimmers at the needle's center.

A brass ring around the edge is engraved with precise notches for finer navigation, and a folding magnifying lens is attached to the side on a delicate hinge. On the back, a tarnished brass plate bears a maker’s mark—a foot carved from stone—and the faint inscription: "To find one’s patkah is to know one’s self."

The Stonefoot Compass’s needle is magically attuned to always point true north, regardless of environmental conditions or magnetic interference. This property allows its user to maintain an accurate heading even in magically distorted locations or under the influence of powerful illusions.

Once per day, while holding the compass in one hand, you can use an action to cast *one* of the following spells through it. The spell requires its normal verbal and somatic components, but the compass serves as the material component:
- [[Find the Path]]
- [[Locate Object]]
- [[Locate Animals or Plants]]

When casting *Find the Path* or *Locate Object* using the compass, you gain these additional benefits and restrictions:

- You automatically succeed on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on that spell as long as you are physically holding the compass in one hand.
- If you stow the compass, drop it, or hand it to another creature, the spell immediately ends
- You cannot maintain concentration on any other spells while *Find the Path* or *Locate Object* is active through the compass
