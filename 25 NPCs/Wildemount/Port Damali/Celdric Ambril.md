## Celunor the Tidebound
The curator of the [[Celunor’s Collection#Legend of the Drowned Library|Drowned Library]] is an enigmatic figure known as Celunor the Tidebound. Legend has it that Celunor was once a renowned archivist and a mage who had an insatiable thirst for knowledge. When the disaster struck that sunk his home and the bastion of lore he cherished, his life's work seemed doomed to be lost beneath the waves. Through a powerful and arcane ritual, Celunor bound his life force to the library, effectively becoming a part of it. As a result, he survived in a state between life and death, sworn to guard the knowledge within for eternity. Celunor is said to have become something more than human—transformed into a being of water and spirit, an elemental guardian of the library’s ancient tomes and scrolls.

## Phrases and Sayings
"Every story has its depth, much like the sea; you only need dare to dive."
"Seek the narrative in the margins; that's where the real stories unfold."
"Pages weather, bindings loosen, but the essence of a tale, that is eternal."
"A stone in the sky never casts a shadow, but always watch for its fall."
"The frog who sleeps on lilies dreams of clouds, but awakes still in the pond."
"A feather aloft may seem free until the wind ceases and it must meet the earth again."
"Beware the oak that grows from a whisper, for its roots are bound in silence."

When asked what these mean, he will look patronizingly on the person asking and say, "My friend, when you have been around Exandria as many times as I have, the meaning is quite obvious is it not? Indeed. Indeed."

Often catches himself rambling on at length about things, at which he will say, "Ah, I'm going on and on. Well, you know what they say: Never trust a river that doesn't babble!"

If asked about the phrase, he may tell one of these stories:

1. Celdric spins a yarn about a silent river he once crossed in a mysterious land where the waters ran deep and dark, without a single sound. He claims the silence was due to a spell cast by an ancient water witch, who cursed the river for revealing her secrets to the local villagers. The river's quietude hid treacherous undercurrents, and from this, Celdric purportedly learned to mistrust the things that are unnaturally silent.
    
2. He tells a fantastical story of a voyage on a ship that was so swift it outpaced its own echo. According to Celdric, the ship's captain had struck a deal with the wind itself, and in doing so, the breeze ceased its usual gossiping with the reeds and the leaves. It was an eerie journey, he insists, and one that taught him the value of listening to nature's whispers for omens.
    
3. Another of his favorite tales involves a desert so vast that not even the sound of sand shifting underfoot could be heard. He claims to have met a tribe of nomads there who worshipped silence, believing it to be the only way to hear the gods. The tribe lived by a silent oasis, which, Celdric says, was a dangerous place filled with invisible predators that moved without a whisper.
    

**The Simple Truth:**
In reality, the phrase came from his childhood. Celdric's parents were always keen on teaching him lessons from nature during their travels. One day, while they were camped by a small brook, his mother pointed out that the water was so clear and quiet you couldn't hear it flowing. She mentioned offhandedly, "Never trust a river that doesn't babble," to highlight that the quietest paths can sometimes be the most treacherous due to unseen undertows or slippery rocks beneath the surface. The mundane origin of the saying stuck with Celdric, although it was nothing more than an observation during a restful afternoon.

## Description
Celdric Ambril, known to many as Celunor the Tidebound, is a figure of enigmatic allure. He is of an indeterminate age that seems to waver between the vigor of youth and the wisdom of someone far more seasoned. His height is average, not tall enough to be imposing nor short enough to be overlooked, and his build straddles the line between wiry strength and scholarly slightness.

His skin holds an ambiguous hue, a mutable olive tone that looks sun-kissed to some and ashen to others, depending on the light and the stories he spins. The fine texture of his skin is unmarked by the blemishes of labor, yet it possesses a certain roughened quality that hints at years of traveling under different suns.

Celdric's eyes are a shifting sea of greens and blues, sometimes bright as the tropical shallows, other times dark as the fathomless deeps. They're framed by thick, dark lashes that rest over high cheekbones, giving him an exotic, almost fey-like quality. His hair is a mass of waves, the color of wet sand, often pulled back to reveal a broad forehead, which he claims is marked by the wisdom of the ancients he's studied.

His nose is straight and of a medium length, but it bears a slight crook—perhaps from a break long ago—that adds a rakish character to his otherwise symmetrical features. His lips are prone to wry smiles and are often the only giveaway of his amusement, as they twitch with mirth when he spins his most outlandish tales.

Celdric's attire is as much a costume as it is clothing, carefully curated to accentuate his ambiguous origins. He favors flowing robes of deep blues and greens, reminiscent of the ocean, adorned with ornaments and trinkets from a myriad of cultures that defy precise origin. Around his neck, he wears an amulet of intricate design, its style a blend that could be attributed to several different civilizations.

He speaks with an accent that is difficult to place, a melange of cadences that seems to draw from many languages and regions. It shifts as easily as his stories, adapting to his audience or the particular heritage he claims in the moment.

This carefully constructed ambiguity about his race and origins is Celdric’s most prized tool. It allows him to be a mirror for the expectations and prejudices of those he encounters, and he uses it to his advantage, to entice, to disarm, and to sell the fantastical tales that make Celunor the Tidebound such a compelling character.

## True Origin of Celdric
Celdric is, in fact, human, born to a pair of traveling merchants in a caravan that roamed the lengths of Wildemount. His parents were skilled traders, often dealing in rare goods and trinkets, which introduced Celdric early to the art of appraisal and salesmanship. However, their caravan was also known for the stories they told, not just for entertainment, but also as a method of increasing the perceived value of their wares.

Celdric was an attentive child, with an innate ability to notice and mimic the subtle mannerisms and accents of the various cultures and races the caravan encountered. This skill made him a chameleon among the trading posts and markets, as he could negotiate with dwarves in the morning and discuss ancient lore with elves by nightfall, each time appearing as if he were one of their own.

His life took a pivotal turn when his parents acquired an old, seemingly mundane book from a mysterious figure. This book, imbued with faint, ancient magic, subtly enhanced Celdric's already notable ability to fit into any crowd. The book wasn't powerful enough to change his appearance drastically, but it did sharpen his features in ways that leaned toward the expectations of whoever he interacted with.

When his parents passed, Celdric took his inheritance and his talents to [[Port Damali]], where he established the [[Celunor’s Collection|Drowned Library]]. The exotic tales of the place's creation and his own shrouded history are a blend of the stories he grew up with and his own creative additions, meant to captivate and intrigue his customers.

But at the heart of it, Celdric is a human with a talent for stories and a deep love for the artifacts and lore that have become his life's work. His past, while not as fantastical as he makes it seem, is filled with genuine experiences of the many faces and places of Exandria, which he uses to his advantage both in business and in personal dealings.
