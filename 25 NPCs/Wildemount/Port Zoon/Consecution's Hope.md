(Captain Rizzen T'orgh).

This ship made an expedition from Xhorhas to the Shattered Teeth in 136 PD, soon after the discovery of the second Luxon Beacon by the Kryn Dynasty. When they found the second, they immediately began searching for more.

The ship found an obsidian shard in the Shattered Teeth that they believed was a piece of a Beacon. (It is in fact a shard of the [[Lorestone of Eryndor]]). While bringing the shard back home, the ship sank just offshore in the Blightshore during a storm.

While resupplying in Port Zoon, one of the ship's crew got too drunk and sold the map of the expedition record to a pirate who hoped to use it to find more treasure in the Shattered Teeth. The map was recently purchased by [[Keldar Stonefoot]] due to its historic cartographic importance.

The route and markings on the map showed it traveled from the Blightshore to the Shattered Teeth. It stopped in Port Zoon on its return journey to resupply and was headed back to Blightshore. The map has notes about the obsidian shard that was picked up in the Shattered Teeth.
