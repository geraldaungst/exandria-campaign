Sumad-Dekon (often called simply Sumad), a keen human wizard with a sharp mind for arcana and history, was recruited by [[Valen Elderguard]] for his controversial theories about the Age of Arcanum. His research into forbidden magics has led him to believe that the opening of the rifts is an opportunity, not a disaster waiting to happen. His hunger for knowledge and power has made him a valuable asset to the [[Emissaries of the Sunfall|Emissaries]].

Has a [[History of Tessa and Sumad-Dekon|prior relationship]] with [[Tessa Sunwarden]] of the [[Obsidian Echoforge]].
