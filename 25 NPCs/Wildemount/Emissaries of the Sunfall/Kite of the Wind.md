Male Tabaxi
Partner of [[Georgina Wiseacre]] though he does not advertise it.

O: Rogue
G: Report back to [[Valen Elderguard|Valen]] about the outcome of the mission
A: Determined but cracks of concern forming
S: Medium high

Escaped when he thought the mission was compromised and impossible. He deeply regrets not saving Georgina, but he didn't see another option. His previous unwavering determination is now getting some small cracks of concern.

Kite will immediately head towards Rexxentrum to report back to [[Valen Elderguard]] about the failed mission. Travel there will take him about 20 days.
