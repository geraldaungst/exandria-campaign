O: Locksmith/Fighter
G: To redirect the skyship to Xhorhas
A: Anxious but hiding it
S: Medium - Believes in the cause, but not willing to die for it

**Description:** A woman with a warm, jovial air about her, she is dressed in an above average manner. Her blonde hair is knotted and matted. Her eyes are violet and she is always smoking a pipe.

**Personality:** Eccentric and domineering, Georgina will drive conversation. She is obsessed with a lost civilization.

**History:** Georgina was born with her mother's beautiful face. Her homeland was ravaged by war and she spent much of her life rebuilding it. She became a Locksmith soon after.

**Ideals:** Extrovert. **Flaws:** PTSD. **Bonds:** Attractive, Adventurer, Job, Family. **Occupation:** Locksmith

**Voice:** Jittery and nervous

Partners with [[Kite of the Wind]] (who escaped) though they are not advertising that.

Info Georgina knows that she might share if interrogated. (DC 15 persuasion if asked by an ally, DC 20 Intimidation if asked by a neutral party, disadvantage on either roll if actively hostile):
- She was paid to recruit a team to redirect the skyship.
- She does not know the source of the funds. She is a mercenary (this is a lie, DC 17 to detect, but she is unwilling to give up her source or her connections, even in death, and even to other so-called allies, because this was a black op, even to the members of the Emissaries)
- The team includes Kite of the Wind, Berinon Truegust, and Guzezzik.
- Georgina is angry at Kite of the Wind if she finds out he escaped--he was supposed to take her with him. Coward!
- No other ship crew or passengers were involved.
- She only knows that the purpose of sending the ship to Xorhas was to divert one of the passengers so they would not reach [[Port Damali]]. (The passenger was Aethor Kalisk, but Georgina does not have his name.)
