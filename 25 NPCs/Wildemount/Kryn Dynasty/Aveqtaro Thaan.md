![[aveqtaro-thaan.png|right|300]]

Aveqtaro Thaan is a drow who is the reincarnation of [[Cadariel Ordo]]. The [[Obsidian Echoforge]] believe she is actually the reincarnation of [[Eryndor]], the prophet, and because Luxon Beacons are associated with the Beacon prophesied to seal the rifts.

Though she is not aware of this early in the campaign, her gradual realization of her true nature could unlock latent memories or intuitive understandings of Exandria's arcane geographies. Thaan might experience flashes of insight that correlate with [[Eryndor]]’s prophecies, revealing **lost lore:** Memories of conversations with [[Eryndor]], including wisdom that might shed light on ambiguous parts of the [[01 The Prophecy|prophecy]] or suggest strategies for dealing with the rifts beyond simply sealing them.

This knowledge could make Thaan an invaluable guide to the PCs, offering them a unique edge in their quest. As someone who once mapped the unseen and the spaces between, her insight would be unmatched, turning her into a different kind of key—a guide to navigating the chaos threatening to engulf their world.
