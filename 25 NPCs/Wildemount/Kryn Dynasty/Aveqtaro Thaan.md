Aveqtaro Thaan is a drow who is the reincarnation of [[Cadariel Ordo]]. The [[Obsidian Echoforge]] believe she is actually the reincarnation of [[Eryndor]], the prophet, and because Luxon Beacons are associated with the Beacon prophesied to seal the rifts.

Though she is not aware of this early in the campaign, her gradual realization of her true nature could unlock latent memories or intuitive understandings of Exandria's arcane geographies. Thaan might experience flashes of insight that correlate with [[Eryndor]]’s prophecies, revealing **lost lore:** Memories of conversations with [[Eryndor]], including wisdom that might shed light on ambiguous parts of the [[01 The Prophecy|prophecy]] or suggest strategies for dealing with the rifts beyond simply sealing them.

This knowledge could make Thaan an invaluable guide to the PCs, offering them a unique edge in their quest. As someone who once mapped the unseen and the spaces between, her insight would be unmatched, turning her into a different kind of key—a guide to navigating the chaos threatening to engulf their world.

## **Dual-Artifact Knowledge from Past Life Memories**

As Aveqtaro's memories as Cadariel Ordo gradually surface, she gains critical insights about the relationship between two powerful artifacts that the Obsidian Echoforge doesn't fully understand:

**The Lorestone-Beacon Connection**: Through fragmentary memories of conversations with Eryndor, Aveqtaro begins to recall that the prophet spoke not of one beacon, but of two different types of "beacons" working in tandem. The Lorestone of Eryndor was designed to function as a "prophetic beacon" - a guide for sealing rifts - while the Luxon Beacons serve as "temporal anchors" that can stabilize the flow of time around chaotic planar breaches. Eryndor's original vision required both artifacts working together.

**Cadariel's Cartographic Insights**: As the memories strengthen, Aveqtaro recalls that Cadariel mapped the intersection points where ley lines and temporal currents converge - the precise locations where a Lorestone and Luxon Beacon could be used together most effectively. His lost master map didn't just chart physical locations, but temporal-planar nexuses where the dual-artifact approach would be most powerful.

**The Missing Ritual Components**: Most crucially, Aveqtaro's recovered memories reveal that Eryndor's original instructions included specific ritual components and timing that require both artifacts. The Lorestone provides the "frequency" for closing rifts, while a Luxon Beacon provides the temporal stability to prevent the closing process from creating dangerous time distortions. Without both working in harmony, attempts to close major rifts risk creating temporal fractures.

**Correcting the Obsidian Echoforge's Assumptions**: These memories put Aveqtaro in the unique position of knowing that the Obsidian Echoforge's current approach - seeking to use the Lorestone alone - is incomplete. However, her memories also reveal that simply possessing both artifacts isn't enough; the wielder must understand the precise geometric and temporal alignments that Cadariel mapped, knowledge that died with him and has been reborn with her.

**The Dynasty's Misunderstanding**: Equally important, Aveqtaro realizes that the Kryn Dynasty's assumption that all Luxon Beacons serve the same purpose is incorrect. While most Beacons facilitate consecution and time magic, certain ones - those Cadariel helped Eryndor identify - were specifically attuned for planar stabilization work. The beacon the Dynasty found in the Shattered Teeth expedition might be one of these specialized artifacts, making it far more valuable than they realize.

**Progressive Memory Recovery**: Initially, these insights come as vague intuitions and half-remembered conversations. As the campaign progresses and Aveqtaro encounters Lorestone shards or Luxon Beacons, the proximity to these artifacts triggers stronger memory episodes, gradually revealing more complete information about proper dual-artifact usage, ritual timing, and the locations where both artifacts can be used most effectively.
