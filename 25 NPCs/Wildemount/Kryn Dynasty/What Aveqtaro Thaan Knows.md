# Core Information

### **Conscious Knowledge (Things she can actively discuss)**

- **Her Identity Crisis**: She's begun experiencing "episodes" where she remembers places she's never been and knows things she shouldn't know about ancient cartography
- **Dynasty Investigation**: She's been tasked with investigating potential connections between certain Luxon Beacons and the rifts, leading her to suspect some Beacons are different from others
- **Prophecy Research**: She's learned about the three factions and the prophecy, and suspects there are missing pieces to the puzzle
- **Lorestone Familiarity**: She's encountered at least one shard and felt an inexplicable connection to it, leading her to research the artifact's history
- **Mapping Compulsion**: She's been compulsively creating maps of rift locations and ley line intersections, though she can't explain why the patterns seem familiar

### **Emerging Memories (Things she's starting to piece together)**

- **Dual-Artifact Theory**: She's developed a hypothesis (which she believes is her own insight) that the Lorestone and certain Luxon Beacons were meant to work together
- **Ancient Conversations**: She sometimes "remembers" discussions about planar stability, though she thinks they're dreams or visions
- **Geometric Certainty**: She has strong intuitions about where rifts are likely to appear and which locations would be ideal for closing them
- **Timing Sensitivities**: She suspects there are optimal times and configurations for using both artifacts together

### **Active Research (Things she's investigating)**

- **The Missing Map**: She's searching for references to an "lost cartographer's masterwork" that supposedly charted planar weak points
- **Beacon Variations**: She's trying to determine why some Luxon Beacons feel "wrong" to her artificer senses
- **Prophecy Gaps**: She suspects there are missing verses that would explain the beacon references more clearly

### **What She's Wrestling With**

- **Identity Questions**: She's starting to wonder if her memories are truly her own
- **Faction Loyalties**: She's loyal to the Dynasty but increasingly convinced that the solution requires cooperation between factions
- **Trust Issues**: She's not sure who she can share her theories with, as they challenge both Dynasty doctrine and faction assumptions
