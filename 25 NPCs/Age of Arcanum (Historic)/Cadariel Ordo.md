Cadariel was a renowned elven cartographer and lorekeeper during the Age of Arcanum, a time when the world was suffused with potent magics and the boundaries between planes were tantalizingly thin. He was an elf of great curiosity and intellect, driven by the desire to map not only the physical realms of Exandria but also the ethereal pathways between worlds. Cadariel was an associate of [[Eryndor]], the prophet, sharing a deep respect for knowledge and the mysteries of the universe.

**Relationship with [[Eryndor]]:** Cadariel and [[Eryndor]] often met under the auspices of seeking truth. [[Eryndor]]'s prophecies intrigued Cadariel, who saw in them patterns that might hint at deeper cosmological truths. Their relationship was one of mutual intellectual stimulation and collaboration. While [[Eryndor]] spoke of things that might come to pass, Cadariel sought to understand how such futures could be reached, both literally and figuratively. They would often be found in the great libraries of the time or under the night sky, debating the stars' influence on the fate of Exandria.

**Cadariel's Legacy:** Cadarielâ€™s greatest work was a master map rumored to chart the leylines and magical nexuses of the world, including sites where the barriers between planes were weakest. This map was said to contain hints to locations that were not just of physical importance but also of prophetic significance, possibly even paths to where the echoes of past and future resonated strongest. Today no trace of the map remains. It is known only through rumor and legend.
