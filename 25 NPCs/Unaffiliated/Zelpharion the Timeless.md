**Zelpharion's Intention**

![[zelpharion.png|right|400]]

The ancient ethereal entity, known in ancient tomes as "Zelpharion the Timeless", exists beyond the confines of Exandria's temporal and spatial dimensions. Its intentions and concerns are often unfathomable to mortals. However, its interest in [[Aelora Willowwhisper|Aelora]] and the Willowwhisper lineage isn't random.

Zelpharion is a guardian of the multiverse's balance. It perceives time and events not as linear sequences but as a vast, interconnected tapestry. The emergence of the planar rifts and the [[01 The Prophecy|prophecy]] surrounding them has caught its attention, for these rifts, if left unchecked, could disrupt the balance of multiple realms.

Zelpharion's intention with [[Aelora Willowwhisper|Aelora]] is twofold:

1. **The Anchor**: Zelpharion needs a connection, an anchor, to the material plane of Exandria to monitor and influence events more directly, ensuring they align with the multiverse's greater balance. [[Aelora Willowwhisper|Aelora]], with her lineage's connection to the [[01 The Prophecy|prophecy]] and the rifts, serves as this anchor. This doesn't mean controlling her actions but rather having a point of observation and subtle influence.
    
2. **The Catalyst**: When the time is right, [[Aelora Willowwhisper|Aelora]] will be called upon to perform a specific ritual that has been lost to time. This ritual doesn't seal the rifts but stabilizes them temporarily, giving Exandria a fighting chance to address them without causing a multiversal cascade. Zelpharion knows that [[Aelora Willowwhisper|Aelora]], with her knowledge and lineage, has the best chance of discovering and successfully performing this ritual.
    

While Zelpharion's intentions are not malevolent, its methods and the demands it might make could be perceived as such by mortals, given the sacrifices and challenges involved. [[Aelora Willowwhisper|Aelora]]'s pact, while born out of desperation, may yet play a pivotal role in preserving not just Exandria but the balance of the broader multiverse.
