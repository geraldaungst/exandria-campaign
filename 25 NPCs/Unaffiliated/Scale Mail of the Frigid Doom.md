# Description
*Armor (Scale Mail), Artifact (Requires Attunement)*
*Scale Mail of the Frigid Doom* is made of the scales of Vorugal himself.

While attuned to and wearing this armor,
You gain:
- +3 bonus to Armor Class
- Advantage on saving throws against the breath weapons of Dragons
- Resistance to Cold damage
- Vulnerability to Fire damage
Additionally, the armor has the following three features:
- **Locate Dragon**: You can focus your senses as a Magic action to discern the distance and direction of the closest dragon within 50 miles of yourself. This action can't be used gain until the next dawn.
- **Frost Ward**: As a Reaction, you may channel Vorugal's icy essence, creating an instantaneous protective ward. An icy shell appears around you. Until the start of your next turn you gain immunity to Fire damage. In addition, any creature who hits you with a melee attack while this ward is active will take 2d8 cold damage. This reaction can't be used again until the next dawn.
- **Curse of the Frigid Doom**: You feel a constant chill after you attune to the armor. Each time you attempt a long rest, you must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to gain its benefits. On a failed save, you gain the benefit of a short rest instead but gain one level of Exhaustion. You also have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws made in Extreme Cold or Frigid Water environments. The chill has no effect on your reaction to Extreme Heat environments. This curse remains even if you doff and unattune from the armor unless removed by a *Remove Curse* or similar magic.
