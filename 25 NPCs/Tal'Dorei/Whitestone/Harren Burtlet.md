Human male, 19 years old. Nephew of [[Garnet Thorne]], who asked him as a "prank" to sneak into [[Tamsin Fieldgold]]'s stall and pour a vial of bitters into the pot of warm spiced mead. He did so and [[Garnet Thorne|Garnet]] was so happy with the result she asked him to go back and do it again the next day. He spilled the bitters into the fire, causing a small fireball which ignited the lanters, the tent, and his clothes.

He is embarrassed about the whole thing (and was told to deny it by [[Garnet Thorne|Garnet]]), so will claim to be a random bystander walking near the stall when it blew up.
