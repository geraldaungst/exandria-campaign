_**Lucky.**_ When Brin rolls a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, he can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

_**Brave.**_ Brin has advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

_**Halfling Nimbleness.**_ Brin can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than his.

_**Naturally Stealthy.**_ Brin can attempt to hide even when he is obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than him.

**Actions**

_**Multiattack.**_ Brin makes two attacks with his short sword or two with his shortbow.

_**Short Sword.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

_**Shortbow.**_ _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

**Reactions**

_**Mischievous Diversion.**_ Once per round, when an enemy targets Brin or an ally within 5 feet of him, Brin can use his reaction to create a distraction. He throws a small object, makes a noise, or uses a quick illusion (like a minor mirage or a sudden sound), causing the attacker to momentarily redirect their attention. The attacker must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on the attack roll. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the attacker's action is wasted as they investigate or react to the diversion.

Brin Shadowfoot is a sprightly Halfling scout with a knack for finding paths where others see none. Standing at about three feet tall, he has a lean build, quick eyes, and an ever-present mischievous grin. Brin's personality is a vibrant mix of humor and cunning; he's always ready with a quip or a clever plan, often using his small stature to his advantage in both playful and practical ways. Despite his lighthearted demeanor, Brin is highly observant and surprisingly wise, offering insightful comments that reveal a deeper understanding of the world around him. His respect for [[Laugu Nalakekali]] stems from her strength and integrity, and in turn, she values his resourcefulness and loyalty. In their partnership, Brin often takes the lead in navigating through the forests, while also ensuring any expedition has its share of laughter and lighthearted moments. His ability to read a situation quickly and adapt makes him an invaluable companion in both peaceful and perilous times.
