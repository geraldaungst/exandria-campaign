Lady Thessaly is a middle-aged human woman known for her obsession with rare gemstones, which she trades and collects as a prominent merchant and socialite throughout the [[Dwendalian Empire]]. She exudes poise and style, never seen without an array of bejeweled rings, bracelets and amulets in a range of violet hues (her namesake favorite).

A while back, she came across rumors of a dangerous and highly unusual creature captured by hunters near Jrusar - a [two-headed etcheda monkey](obsidian://open?vault=D%26D%20Compendium&file=bestiary%2Ftwo-headed-etcheda-monkey). Able to emit blinding flashes from crystalline sacs in its skull when threatened, it seemed the perfect exotic pet for the wealthy trader. She negotiated quickly through a proxy in [[Port Damali]] with black market connections, sparing no expense for the creature she planned to keep as a sparkling oddity to show off with pride.

However, truly domesticating the primal, cunning monkey has proven impossible even for one as willful as Lady Amethyst. After her "pet" blinded two hired beast tamers and destroyed much of her townhouse furnishings with its sharp crystalline claws, she has opted to sell it off - believing the eccentric Dr. Anna Ripley of Whitestone's rural estate has eccentric desires matching the challenge of this unusual beast.

Willing to do anything to guarantee safe, undiscovered transport, Lady Amethyst may react with entitled indignation if her smuggled cargo gets loose or she's uncovered. But she also fears her high-society status falling if word got out about her damaging and impulsive purchase as curiosity overwhelms reason. The risk of transport is better than the alternatives...
