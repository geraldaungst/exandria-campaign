His skin is a deep, earthy green, and it's marked with faint scars - remnants of a tumultuous past. His eyes, a piercing shade of gray, exude a sense of calm wisdom and deep understanding. His head is shaved clean, and he sports a well-groomed beard that adds to his contemplative demeanor.

## Attire:

Korvin dresses in simple, unadorned robes, typically in muted colors like browns or grays, which are both practical for his duties and reflective of his monastic vows of humility. Around his neck hangs a small, unassuming amulet with the symbol of Bahamut, the only visible sign of his religious affiliation.
