Garnet Thorne, around 50 years old, is the esteemed owner of a local award-winning brewery. She has a robust and sturdy physique, reflecting years of hands-on work in her brewery. Standing at an average height, she exudes a quiet strength and an air of confidence.

Her face, marked with fine lines and a sun-kissed complexion, tells a story of years spent overseeing the brewing process and managing the business. Her eyes are a sharp, piercing blue, reminiscent of the clear sky, and they reflect her keen business acumen. Her hair is a mix of chestnut brown and strands of grey, worn in a practical, no-nonsense short cut that's easy to manage and keep out of the way during her work.

Garnet's attire is simple yet functional, preferring comfort and practicality over fashion. She typically wears a plain, well-worn linen shirt paired with durable trousers, suitable for a day's work in the brewery. Her hands are calloused, evidence of her hands-on approach to her craft, and she often has a faint aroma of hops and barley about her.

Despite her wealth, she eschews jewelry and makeup, finding little use for them in her daily routine. Her expression is usually one of thoughtful concentration, but she's quick to smile and laugh, showing a warm and approachable side to those she trusts. Her voice is rich and resonant, often heard giving orders in the brewery or sharing a hearty laugh with her employees and customers.

Overall, Garnet presents as a down-to-earth, hardworking woman who has built her success through dedication and a deep love for her craft.
