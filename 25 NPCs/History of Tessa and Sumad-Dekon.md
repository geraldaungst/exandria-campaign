[[Sumad-Dekon Harrowgate]] and [[Tessa Sunwarden]] met during their early years while studying at the Soltryce Academy in Rexxentrum. Their relationship began purely academic, bonded by a shared insatiable curiosity for the mysteries of the arcane and the history of Exandria. Both were top students, often seen debating fiercely over ancient texts and theorems in the grand halls of the academy, pushing each other to greater academic heights. However, their relationship gradually deepened beyond mere scholarly pursuit.

In the competitive environment of the Soltryce Academy, [[Sumad-Dekon Harrowgate|Sumad]] and [[Tessa Sunwarden|Tessa]] found solace in their companionship, understanding each other's ambitions and dreams. They were each other's confidants, and the intensity of their partnership naturally kindled a more profound affection. However, their romantic feelings remained unspoken, masked by the pretense of academic rivalry and mutual respect.

Their paths diverged when [[Tessa Sunwarden|Tessa]]'s celestial heritage began manifesting in ways that drew her out of the academic world and into the field. She felt a call to action, a need to make an immediate difference, which eventually led her to join the [[Obsidian Echoforge]] as a field agent. [[Sumad-Dekon Harrowgate|Sumad]], on the other hand, became increasingly consumed by his research into the arcane, particularly the controversial subjects that others shied away from. This pursuit of forbidden knowledge distanced him from [[Tessa Sunwarden|Tessa]] and ultimately led him to the [[Emissaries of the Sunfall]].

Their separate affiliations put an additional strain on their already complex relationship. Despite their diverging paths, the emotional bond formed during their formative years at the academy lingers. There remains a tension between them, a mix of old camaraderie, unresolved romantic tension, and the newfound reality of being on opposing sides of a prophetic schism. Neither has fully confronted these emotions, as both are deeply entrenched in their current causes, but their shared history and unspoken feelings add layers of complexity to their interactions whenever their paths cross.
