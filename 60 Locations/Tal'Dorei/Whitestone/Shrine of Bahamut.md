## Exterior of the Shrine:

The shrine to Bahamut in Whitestone is a modest structure, befitting Bahamut's preference for austerity over grandiosity. It stands unassuming amidst the city's architecture, with a simple design that belies its sacred nature. The building is made of whitewashed stone with a roof of slate tiles. A single, modest spire rises from the structure, symbolizing a connection to the divine. The entrance features a plain wooden door, above which is carved a symbol of Bahamut - a dragon's head in profile, exuding a sense of quiet dignity.

## Interior of the Shrine:

Inside, the shrine is a tranquil space, stripped of opulence, reflecting Bahamut's values of wisdom over wealth. The walls are adorned with simple tapestries depicting scenes from Bahamut's lore, such as his battles against his sister Tiamat and his guidance of the dragonborn. A small altar at the far end of the shrine holds a modest icon of Bahamut in his dragon form, crafted from silver with eyes of sapphire, radiating a gentle, calming presence. The space is primarily used for quiet meditation and reflection rather than elaborate rituals.

### 6. Bahamut's Promise to Whitestone
In this final tapestry, we see Bahamut in his human guise, a wise and elderly figure, standing under the Sun Tree in Whitestone. Lord Percival de Rolo, a tall human with a shock of pure white hair and wire-rimmed glasses, stands in earnest conversation with Bahamut, gesturing towards the city. Lady Vexâ€™ahlia de Rolo, a tall, beautiful half-elven woman with hazel eyes and long brown hair, and an accomplished ranger, stands beside Percy with her faithful bear companion, Trinket, a large brown bear wearing armor, symbolizing her connection to nature and her protective instincts.

The children of the de Rolo family are also present, each engaged in an activity that reflects their potential future roles in Whitestone. They are shown in a manner that conveys curiosity and respect towards Bahamut, emphasizing the family's deep connection to the city and its future.

The Sun Tree looms overhead, its branches spreading protectively over the group, symbolizing the city's renewal and growth under the guidance and watchful eye of the de Rolo family and Bahamut. The entire scene radiates a sense of unity, hope, and a shared commitment to the prosperity and protection of Whitestone.
