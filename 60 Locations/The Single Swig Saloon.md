# Introduction
In a realm where worlds converge, the unassuming *Single Swig Saloon* has become a planar crossroads for the cosmically displaced. Under Elira Windacre's guidance, this haven proffers sanctuary and kinship to any who enter. Yet the Saloon's warm embrace belies an enigmatic truth: its very existence seems to transcend reality's laws. Ephemeral tales are spun of the tavern materializing across worlds, of evenings dilated into what felt like eternities, of inexplicable occurrences whispering of cosmic forces beyond reckoning. For the Saloon has become renowned across planes for its signature libation - the Shadowdance Sake, a single, exquisite shot whose rich essence evokes the sublime tranquility of a moonless night. Those fortunate enough to find themselves--whether by chance or by fate--at the Single Swig cannot shake the tantalizing sense that, beneath its welcoming veneer, delicious mysteries await the intrepid soul.

# Backstory of the Single Swig Saloon

The Single Swig Saloon, a name that humbly nods to its origins, was founded by Ormund Faelan, a charismatic and adventurous soul with a penchant for rare spirits and a heart for gathering people. Unbeknownst to Ormund, the land on which he built his beloved tavern was no ordinary plot but a dormant Fey crossing, a thin veil between the worlds where the boundaries of the multiverse whisper to one another. This mystical underpinning remained quiet until a peculiar convergence of magical events: a lunar eclipse, a comet passing, and an arcane ritual gone awry in the vicinity, which awakened the crossing's powers. Thus, the tavern began its extraordinary journey through the multiverse, appearing in various realms for fleeting visits.

Ormund, with his innate connection to the land and a spirit touched by wanderlust, seemed almost chosen by fate for this. Over his thirty-year tenure, he turned the Saloon's unique predicament into its most enchanting feature, welcoming beings from across the cosmos and learning secrets of distillation and brew from each world visited.

# First Proprietor: Ormund Faelan

Ormund, a man of warmth and wit, originally envisioned the Single Swig as a local haven for weary travelers and a repository of tales. He was as much a staple of the tavern as the drinks he served, known for his endless stories and a rare ability to make anyone feel at home. His leadership saw the tavern through its most formative years, guiding it with an open heart and an adventurous spirit.

# New Ownership

Ormund Faelan, after thirty years of steering the Single Swig Saloon through its wondrous journey across the multiverse, began to feel the weight of his age and the call for a different kind of adventure. Though his spirit remained as vibrant as ever, he sensed it was time for a new chapter, both for himself and the Saloon. Ormund had always believed that change was essential for growth and that the Saloon, with its unique nature, would benefit from fresh energy and perspective to guide its next era.

Elira Windacre, a regular patron turned dear friend, had shown an affinity for the tavern that went beyond mere fondness. Her background as an adventurer had endowed her with a resilience and wisdom that Ormund admired, and her time spent away from adventuring within the walls of the Single Swig had revealed her keen understanding of its heart. Ormund saw in Elira not just a successor, but a kindred spirit who shared his sense of wonder and commitment to the Saloon’s community. He recognized her ability to blend the traditions of the past with the potential of the future, ensuring that the tavern would continue to be a haven for all, regardless of where—or when—it found itself.

Moreover, Ormund’s decision was influenced by a desire to explore the very worlds that the Saloon had briefly visited. His longing to witness the realms and peoples he had only glimpsed through the tales of his patrons grew stronger with each passing day. Passing the Saloon to Elira allowed him the freedom to embark on this personal quest, secure in the knowledge that the tavern was in capable hands.

On a deeper level, Ormund's choice was a testament to his trust in Elira's ability to navigate the Saloon's unique challenges—especially its unpredictable journeys across the multiverse. He believed that Elira's adventurous spirit, combined with her astute leadership skills, would usher in a new era of prosperity and adventure for the Single Swig Saloon, ensuring that its legacy would continue to thrive under her guardianship.

Their transition was marked by a heartfelt ceremony attended by the Saloon’s regulars, both from this world and beyond. Ormund didn’t just pass on the keys to the Saloon; he shared with Elira his collection of untold stories, secret recipes, and the unwritten laws of the crossing, entrusting her with the soul of the Single Swig. This gesture signified not the end of Ormund’s tale, but the continuation of the Saloon’s story under a new steward, bound by the same spirit of adventure and community that had always defined it.

# Three Unusual Events

1. **The Infinite Ale Night**: Once, the Saloon appeared in a realm where time flowed differently, and a single night stretched into what felt like months for its patrons. The ale never ran dry, the laughter never ceased, and friendships were forged for a lifetime, all within the span of what, back home, was a single evening.
2. **The Gathering of Echoes**: An accidental convergence of bards from various worlds led to an impromptu festival that is now legend. The music played that night resonated with the crossing's magic, creating echoes that can sometimes be heard faintly in the Saloon at dusk.
 3. **The Feywild Feast**: On an unexpected visit to the Feywild, the tavern hosted a feast with the local fey court. The event was filled with enchantments, causing the Saloon and its occupants to briefly gain abilities of minor shape-shifting, leaving patrons with tales of having danced the night away in forms not their own.

### Three Employees

1. **Tibbs Quiverleaf**: A sprightly halfling with an uncanny memory for drink preferences and an infectious laugh. Tibbs is the head bartender, known for mixing drinks that seem to match a patron's mood perfectly.
2. **Mara Shadowend**: A quiet, observant tiefling who serves as the Saloon's bouncer. Mara has an innate ability to sense trouble before it starts, ensuring peace is kept, often with a mere look or a softly spoken word.
3. **Grennik**: The mysterious cook, whose species is still a topic of debate. Grennik communicates through a series of grunts and gestures but creates dishes that are universally adored, combining flavors from countless worlds.

### Five Regulars

1. **Old Jorrum**: A dwarf who has been patronizing the Single Swig since its opening. He claims to have tried every drink and insists none can best Ormund's original brew. Jorrum's tales of the early days are a beloved fixture.
2. **Zephyra Trephlax**: A recent addition, a young mage fascinated by the tavern's crossings. She documents its appearances across the multiverse, trying to predict its movements with arcane algorithms.
3. **The Twins, Flick and Quick**: Gnome inventors who use the tavern as their workshop when it visits new realms, gathering exotic materials for their creations. Their experiments occasionally go awry, adding to the tavern's lore.
4. **Faelenya Liriel**: An elf bard whose songs capture the essence of the Saloon's travels. Her melodies seem to weave magic, often leaving patrons feeling as though they've traveled with the tavern, even if they've never left their seats.
5. **Rorik Montride**: A human merchant who stumbled upon the tavern during one of its multiverse stops. Fascinated by the concept, he now uses the tavern's unique situation to trade goods across the worlds, always returning with exotic items to sell or stories to share.
