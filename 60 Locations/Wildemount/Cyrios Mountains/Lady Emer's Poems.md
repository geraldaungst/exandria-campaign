## To One Who Dwells in Memory's Keep

Your visage haunts these mountain halls,
Though seasons pass and winter calls,
My serpent locks do twist and writhe,
Yet still my pulse beats strong and blithe.

In chambers cold where echoes ring,
I hear your voice in everything—
The whispered wind, the creaking stone,
Remind me I am not alone.

Though transformation marks my face,
And others flee my dwelling place,
Stone hearts beat with temporal rhythm,
For you, dear one, I'd brave all schism.

The gold of sunrise cannot match
The warmth your memory does attach
To corridors of lonely years—
My changed form sheds no bitter tears.

## The Chef's Chisel

_A meditation on cooking and stone carving_

Behold!
    The mortar and pestle,
        grinding spices into dust—
            is this not the same
                as the sculptor's chisel
                    breaking marble into beauty?

Both transform.
Both create from destruction.

In the kitchen's sacred heat,
    flour becomes bread through violence—
        kneading, pounding, fire.
In the workshop's dusty silence,
    stone becomes art through patience—
        chipping, smoothing, time.

        What profound truth lies here?
            (I wonder as I observe
             the parallel processes
             of creation)

The cook's blade descends—
    carrots surrender their form.
The carver's tool strikes—
    granite yields its essence.

Both seek the same transcendent goal:
    to transform raw matter
        through will,
            through vision,
                through the alchemy
                    of mortal hands
                        making meaning
                            from chaos.

This is the deepest wisdom—
    we are all sculptors
        of our daily bread.
