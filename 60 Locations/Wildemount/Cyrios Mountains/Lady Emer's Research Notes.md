All of the research notes below are scattered among Lady Emer's notebooks, papers, and books in her library. Searching the library for a time will reveal some of the information.

A brief search (15 minutes or less) may locate two items. Roll an Investigation check. Use the list below to determine which items are found based on the roll.

Longer searches will locate more items, as well as making them easier to find. For every 30 minutes spent searching, the party will locate 2 more items and the DC for every category is reduced by 2.

## Easily Found (DC 10 to Locate)

### Personal Transformation Research

_Day 52 - Connecting the Dots_

My transformation occurred when I encountered a planar rift near the Marrow Valley. The energy signature was identical to what I now observe in the Savalir Wood rift. This suggests my medusa transformation was not random curse but **direct exposure to rift energy**.

**Implications**:
- Rift energy can cause permanent biological transformation
- The transformation follows recognizable patterns (petrification-related abilities)
- **I may be the key to understanding how rift energy affects living beings**

**Experiment proposal**: Controlled exposure of test subjects to minimal rift energy. _(Several pages of increasingly unethical experimental designs follow)_

**Note**: Must acquire subjects who won't be missed. Bandits? Prisoners from Vaud's operations?

### Correspondence Fragment - Unknown Recipient

_Date unclear_

"...your interest in my research is flattering, but I must decline your offer to 'enhance' my studies. I've seen what happened to Molaesmyr, and I have no intention of repeating their mistakes. The temporal stabilization you describe sounds promising, but until you can provide more concrete proof of your methods..."

_(The letter breaks off mid-sentence. No indication of who the recipient was.)_

### Theoretical Framework - Rift Origins

_Day 45_

Working theory: The rifts are not random tears but **intentional gateways** created during the Calamity as escape routes or invasion points. They've remained dormant for centuries and are now reactivating due to some external trigger.

**Evidence supporting this theory**:

- Rifts appear at strategically significant locations
- The synchronized pulsing suggests coordinated activation
- Energy signatures match pre-Calamity magical techniques

**Evidence against**:

- No historical records of such gateway networks
- Rift locations don't match known Calamity battlefields
- Energy patterns are too chaotic for deliberate construction

**Alternative theory**: Something is actively _creating_ new rifts from the other side. The patterns suggest intelligence, but not necessarily ancient origin.

### Collaboration Notes - Vaud Qalix

_Correspondence dated 3 months ago_

Vaud's theories about "harmonic resonance" are intriguing but flawed. He believes each rift has a unique "signature" that can be catalogued and predicted. I've tried to explain that the energy patterns I observe are chaotic fluctuations, not meaningful signatures, but he insists his calculations are correct.

**Important**: Vaud mentioned he's seeking something called an "Arcanist's Prism" for his portal project. Claims it's essential for "final stabilization." I should investigate whether this artifact could be useful for my own research.

**Trading opportunity**: He wants access to my Phase Spider specimens. In exchange, he's offered to share his "rift signature database." Might be worth it despite my doubts about his methods.

### Final Entry - Growing Concerns

_Day 78_

Something is wrong with my research site. The Ashkeeper rift has grown 30% larger in the past week, and the energy fluctuations are becoming more violent. Worse, I've been having dreams about a rift in the Savalirwood - dreams where I see figures moving on the other side, watching me through the tear in reality.

**Critical decision needed**: Do I continue research and risk exposure to whatever is causing these changes, or do I retreat and lose this opportunity to understand the phenomenon?

The temporal resonance crystal I acquired may be the key to safely studying the rifts during their active phases. Must accelerate those experiments.

**Note**: If something happens to me, my research should be sent to the Cobalt Soul in Zadash. They have the resources to continue this work safely.

## Hard to Find (DC 20 to locate)

### Planar Rift Analysis - General Observations

_Day 12 - Ashkeeper Peaks Survey_

The rifts appear to follow ley line intersections, but not all ley line crossings produce rifts. There's another factor at work - possibly related to historical magical trauma. The Ashkeeper Peaks rift sits directly above what my geological surveys suggest was once a massive magical explosion, likely from the Calamity era.

**Hypothesis**: Rifts form where ley lines intersect AND where the planar barriers were previously weakened by catastrophic magical events.

_Day 18_

**BREAKTHROUGH!** The rifts pulse in a synchronized pattern every 47 minutes and 23 seconds. This cannot be coincidence. There must be a central source or controlling mechanism that regulates all rifts simultaneously.

### Material Analysis - Planar Samples

_Day 67_

**Feywild crystal** (from Ashkeeper rift): Maintains faint enchantment even when removed from rift proximity. Could be useful as spell components. Weight: 2.3 lbs, estimated value: 200gp.

**Shadowfell ichor** (from Savalirwood rift): **WARNING - HANDLE WITH CARE.** Constant whispers when touched. Appears to absorb light and heat. May be sentient. Weight: 1.7 lbs. Do not recommend sale or trade. Gray color: connected to temporal resonance crystal? Must explore this possibility.

**Fire elemental residue** (from Cyrios rift): Maintains temperature of approximately 150 degrees indefinitely. Useful for alchemical work. Weight: 0.8 lbs, estimated value: 75gp.

**Unknown material** (from Ebonglass rift): Defies classification. Appears solid but occasionally becomes translucent. Sometimes seems to move when not observed directly. **DO NOT TOUCH WITH BARE SKIN.** Weight varies between 0.5-3.2 lbs depending on observation method.

### Energy Signature Analysis

_Day 31 - Multiple Rift Comparison_

**Confirmed observation**: Smaller rifts (under 5 feet diameter) can be temporarily stabilized using standard _Dispel Magic_ effects, but the stabilization only lasts 2-4 hours before the rift reopens, usually larger than before.

**WARNING**: Attempted _Banishment_ on rift energy resulted in backlash that left me unconscious for 6 hours. The rift briefly _tripled_ in size before returning to normal. Never attempt banishment magic near active rifts.

**Energy types observed**:

- Ashkeeper Peaks: Elemental Air + trace Feywild energy
- Cyrios foothills: Pure Elemental Fire
- Savalir Wood: Shadowfell + unknown planar signature _(possibly Far Realm)_

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: The "unknown signature" from Savalir Wood is the same energy type I detected around my transformation site years ago. This cannot be coincidence.
