## Adventure Background

High in the Cyrios Mountains of southern Wildemount lies a forgotten monastery carved from living rock and natural cave systems. Three centuries ago, a sect of firbolg monks known as the Order of Dimensional Harmony built this sanctuary to study and "heal" phase spiders they believed were suffering from dimensional corruption. The monks' compassionate but misguided research led to a catastrophic end when they attempted to stabilize a planar rift and cross through it to another realm. Their final ritual partially succeeded - many monks crossed over - but the rift then collapsed catastrophically, trapping survivors and leaving a permanent dimensional scar.

---

## Environmental Conditions

### Climate and Atmosphere

The monastery sits at high altitude in the Cyrios Mountains, where the air is thin, dry, and bitterly cold. However, once inside the complex, the temperature moderates to a cool but tolerable level due to the mountain's insulating stone. The air inside is remarkably still, broken only by occasional drafts that whisper through connecting passages and hint at the complex's extensive cave network.

### Architectural Features

**Ceiling Height**: Most constructed chambers have 13-foot ceilings, sized for the original inhabitants but accommodating to visitors of typical stature.

**Gravitational Anomaly**: All horizontal surfaces throughout the monastery slant slightly toward Area 18, a residual effect from the catastrophic dimensional experiment. This slope is subtle enough that it doesn't affect movement or balance, but liquids always flow in that direction, and round objects will slowly roll unless secured. Characters pouring water, spilling wine, or dropping marbles will notice this consistent directional pull.

### Lighting Conditions

**Total Darkness**: The monastery has no natural light sources. All torches, braziers, and oil lamps have long since been extinguished. Characters will need their own light sources to navigate safely. The darkness is complete and oppressive - even areas near the entrance receive no illumination from outside.

### Constructed vs. Natural Areas

**Worked Stone Sections** (Areas 1-9, 16, 21): These chambers feature smooth walls, level floors (aside from the slight slope), and precise stonework. Surfaces are cold to the touch but dry. Sound carries normally but seems muffled by the stone.

**Natural Cave Sections** (Areas 10-15, 17-20): These areas follow irregular contours with varying ceiling heights, natural rock formations, and uneven surfaces. The stone here is rougher, sometimes damp with condensation, and creates interesting acoustic effects - whispers may echo unexpectedly while shouts might be absorbed entirely.

### Adventure Hooks

- **Planar Researchers**: The party is hired by scholars studying dimensional rifts to investigate reports of strange ethereal disturbances emanating from the Cyrios peaks.
- **Missing Expedition**: A group of mountain climbers discovered the entrance but never returned. Their families offer a reward for answers.
- **Phase Spider Encounters**: Travelers report phase spiders behaving strangely near the mountains - some appearing almost... sad?
- **Ancient Knowledge**: Rumors speak of firbolg texts containing pre-Calamity dimensional magic housed in a lost mountain monastery.
- **Mountain Passage**: Local guides mention an old story about a "path through the mountain" that avoids the dangerous exterior passes.

---

## The Entrance

### Discovery

A recent avalanche has cleared centuries of accumulated rockfall and snow, revealing a **rectangular opening** (5 feet wide, 8 feet tall) carved directly into the mountain face. The opening appears artificial, with smooth stone edges that show tool marks from long ago.

**Investigation (DC 15)**: The tool marks are consistent with firbolg stoneworking techniques. The passage extends into darkness beyond the reach of normal light.

**Survival (DC 12)**: The avalanche occurred recently - within the past few weeks. Animal tracks around the entrance suggest local wildlife is avoiding the area.

### The Entrance Passage

A 30-foot corridor slopes gently downward into the mountain. The walls show ancient chisel marks and are carved from solid granite. Halfway down the passage, keen-eyed characters notice:

**Perception (DC 14)**: Faint scratch marks on the walls at shoulder height - too regular to be natural. These are territorial markings left by phase spiders.

**Arcana (DC 16)**: The air here shimmers occasionally, suggesting weak points between the Material and Ethereal planes.

---

## Level 1 (Upper Level)

## Area 1: Entrance Stairway

_Transition from surface to monastery proper_

### Description

> The sloping entrance passage ends at a carved stone stairway that descends 20 feet deeper into the mountain. The steps are wide and deep, clearly sized for larger inhabitants, but manageable for most humanoids. Ancient iron torch brackets line the walls, their metal darkened with age. The air grows noticeably cooler as you descend and carries a faint metallic taste.

### Features

- **Firbolg Construction**: The stairs show excellent stonework but are sized for Large creatures
- **Dimensional Resonance**: Magic items begin to glow faintly here
- **Hidden Observation**: Phase spiders in Areas 10-12 may watch newcomers from the Ethereal Plane

---

## Area 2: Reception Chamber

_Formal entrance for guests and ceremonies_

### Description

> This rectangular chamber spans 20 by 30 feet with smooth granite walls rising to a 13-foot ceiling. Stone benches line the long walls, sized larger than typical human furniture. Several alcoves hold the remnants of what might once have been ceremonial items: wooden bowls darkened with age, tarnished metal implements, and cloth that appears intact but looks brittle. Doorways lead deeper into the complex.

### Features

- **Stone Benches**: Carved for larger inhabitants (Medium creatures sit normally, Small creatures need to climb up)
- **Ceremonial Alcoves**: Contain remarkably well-preserved wooden bowls (darkened with age but intact), metal implements with only light tarnish, and ceremonial cloth that is intact but brittle to the touch
- **Construction**: _[Worked stone - carved by the original inhabitants]_

**DM Notes**:

- **Dimensional Instability**: Magic items glow faintly here; spells with random effects (like _Wild Magic_) have a 10% chance of triggering unusual results
- **Cultural Clues**: The oversized furniture suggests the original inhabitants were larger than typical humanoids (firbolgs)

### Hidden Elements

**Investigation (DC 18)**: One alcove contains a **prayer book** with pages that have become brittle and yellow with age but remain legible. Written in Giant script, it describes rituals for "cleansing dimensional corruption" and "communion with ethereal spirits." (Requires careful handling - rough treatment may damage pages)

**DM Notes**: This is a firbolg prayer book that reveals the monastery's original purpose.

### Encounters

- **1d3 Phase Spiders** may be present, watching from the Ethereal Plane
- If combat occurs, they phase in and out unpredictably
- These spiders are curious rather than immediately hostile - they remember this place and are investigating the new arrivals

---

## Area 3: Monk's Residence

_Communal sleeping quarters_

### Description

> This large rectangular chamber served as sleeping quarters. Stone sleeping platforms line the walls, each with carved storage niches and simple desks. The beds are unusually large but could accommodate smaller occupants. Personal belongings remain scattered about: clothing, simple tools, and various personal items that appear remarkably well-preserved. The chamber could have housed 15-20 occupants comfortably.

### Features

- **Sleeping Platforms**: 18 stone beds with integrated storage
- **Personal Effects**: Clothing, simple tools, and personal items remain remarkably well-preserved
- **Central Brazier**: A large fire bowl provided heat for the chamber (cold ashes remain)

**DM Notes**: The journals detail early firbolg observations of phase spider behavior. The dagger has firbolg runes.

---

## Area 4: Crossroads

_Junction between monastery sections_

### Description

> This wide, open area serves as the intersection of two major corridors. The ceiling rises higher here - about 15 feet - and the space feels more like a natural cavern that has been smoothed and widened. Stone markers carved with symbols in Giant script point toward different areas: "Living Quarters," "Workshop," "Sacred Spaces," and "Research Areas."

### Features

- **Phase Spider Tunnel**: 50% chance of encountering 1-2 **Phase Spiders** using this as a travel route

---

## Area 6: Dining and Recreation Area

_Communal gathering space_

### Description

> This long chamber served multiple purposes. Large stone tables with attached benches could seat a sizable community for meals. Game boards carved into some table surfaces suggest this space also served for recreation and leisure. A massive stone fireplace dominates one wall, with a chimney that disappears into the mountain above. Storage alcoves hold dishes, game pieces, and various communal items.

### Features

- **Communal Tables**: Stone furniture sized for firbolgs but usable by all
- **Game Surfaces**: Stone game boards for various strategy games carved into tables
- **Great Fireplace**: Large enough to heat the entire chamber and cook for groups
- **Recreation Storage**: Wooden game pieces, simple instruments, and books

### Social Discovery

**Investigation (DC 14)**: Game pieces and worn table surfaces suggest this was a lively, social community before the tragedy.

---

## Area 7: Storage

_General supplies and equipment_

### Description

> This chamber served as primary storage. Stone shelves and wooden crates contain a variety of supplies: tools, materials, clothing, and ceremonial items. Everything is methodically organized with clearly labeled areas marked in Giant script. The organization suggests the inhabitants were methodical and well-prepared.

### Features

- **Organized Storage**: Clearly labeled areas in Giant script
- **Tool Collection**: Stoneworking tools, rope, climbing gear, and basic equipment

- **Ventilation**: Fresh air circulation prevents odors
- **Privacy Divisions**: Stone partitions between stations
- **Construction**: _[Worked stone utilizing natural water features]_

---

## Areas 10-12: Natural Spider Dens

_Former natural caves, now phase spider territory_

### Description (Each Area)

> These natural caverns were left largely unmodified by the original inhabitants. The caves feature irregular walls, varying ceiling heights from 8 to 20 feet, and natural stone formations including stalactites and flowstone. Webs stretch between rock formations - not ordinary spider webs, but something that seems to shimmer and become more visible when disturbed. The air itself seems to shimmer occasionally.

### Features

- **Unusual Webs**: Ethereal silk that becomes more visible when touched or disturbed
- **Natural Formation**: Stalactites, flowstone, and other typical cave features
- **Rough Tunnel**: Area 12 connects to Area 5 via a crudely carved tunnel showing claw marks
- **Construction**: _[Natural caves - unmodified by original inhabitants]_

**DM Notes**:

- **Phase Spider Territory**: These areas are now claimed by phase spiders as nesting areas
- **Dimensional Resonance**: Constant phase spider presence has made barriers between planes thin here

### Current Occupants

- **Area 10**: 1d3 **Phase Spiders** (50% chance present)
- **Area 11**: 1 **Phase Spider** with **2d4 eggs** (75% chance present)
- **Area 12**: 1-2 **Phase Spiders** (always present - guards tunnel to Area 5)

### Encounters

- **Non-Hostile Options**: These spiders are not immediately aggressive if approached peacefully
- **Territorial Defense**: They will defend their nests if threatened
- **Ethereal Advantage**: Spiders can attack from the Ethereal Plane using natural terrain

---

## Area 13: Prayer Hall

_Natural cave converted for communal worship_

### Description

> This natural cavern has been adapted for spiritual purposes while respecting its original form. The builders added minimal modifications: carved seats that follow the cave's natural contours, and stone altars positioned throughout the space. The ceiling varies from 10 to 20 feet in height, creating an awe-inspiring sense of scale. Natural stone formations have been carved with geometric patterns that seem to shift slightly when viewed from different angles.

### Features

- **Natural Acoustics**: The cave shape amplifies voices and creates resonant tones
- **Carved Seating**: Stone benches that follow the natural rock contours
- **Sacred Geometry**: Wall carvings designed to focus dimensional awareness
- **Altar Spaces**: Multiple stone platforms for different ceremonial purposes
- **Ethereal Bleed**: Dimensional meditation practices have made ethereal creatures partially visible here
- **Construction**: _[Natural cavern with minimal worked stone additions]_

### Sacred Features

- **Meditation Circles**: Characters who spend 10 minutes meditating here gain advantage on their next Arcana or Investigation check
- **Shifting Patterns**: Staring too long at wall carvings requires a DC 13 Wisdom save or suffer brief disorientation (disadvantage on next action)

---

## Area 14: Workshop (Primary)

_Main crafting and dimensional equipment construction_

### Description

> This large natural cavern has been extensively modified for workshop use. Workbenches have been carved from the living rock at various heights throughout the space. Stone anvils, tool racks, and material storage areas fill the available space. A sophisticated ventilation system uses the natural cave airflow - you can feel subtle drafts moving through carved channels in the walls.

---

## Area 16: Workshop (Secondary) with External Access

_Specialized heavy work area with mountain access_

### Description

> Unlike the natural caverns elsewhere, this chamber was deliberately carved as a rectangular room. The construction is notably precise - perfectly level floors and straight walls that contrast sharply with the organic cave system nearby. Stone surfaces are carved with permanent geometric guides and measurement marks. A carved stairway leads upward, disappearing into darkness.

### Features

- **Precision Construction**: Perfectly level floors and straight walls essential for dimensional calculations
- **Mathematical Workspace**: Stone surfaces carved with permanent geometric guides and measurement marks
- **Containment Testing**: Reinforced areas where dimensional fields could be safely tested
- **External Access**: Stone stairway leading to hidden exit (allows passage through the mountain)
- **Isolation Design**: Separated from other areas to prevent dimensional interference
- **Construction**: _[Worked stone - purpose-built for precision dimensional work]_

### Why Constructed Rather Than Natural?

The monks discovered that dimensional magic requires geometric precision that natural caves cannot provide. Irregular surfaces create unpredictable resonances in dimensional fields, making containment magic unstable. This room's mathematical precision was essential for:

- Calibrating dimensional anchor fields
- Testing containment rune patterns
- Creating the precise crystal matrices used in viewing equipment
- Training monks in dimensional manipulation without endangering others

### Workshop Contents

- **Dimensional Calibration Tools**: Precise measuring devices for magical field work
- **Testing Apparatus**: Safe equipment for dimensional field experimentation
- **Rune Carving Station**: Tools for creating precise magical symbols

### External Exit

**Hidden Exit (Survival DC 18 to find from outside)**: The stairway leads to a concealed opening on the mountain's far side, disguised as a natural crack. This provided the monks with emergency escape and supply access.

---

## Area 17: Observatory Chamber

_The heart of the monks' research_

### Description

> This chamber represents a remarkable blend of natural cave and precise stonework. Natural stone formations rise from the floor, but they've been enhanced and connected by carved steps and ramps. Dozens of small alcoves line the walls, each fitted with crystal viewing ports that gleam with a faint inner light. Stone tablets and papers are scattered throughout the room on various platforms and work surfaces.

### Features

- **Viewing Alcoves**: 18 alcoves originally designed to observe phase spiders safely
- **Crystal Arrays**: 6 alcoves still contain **Crystals of True Seeing** (allow Ethereal Sight for 1 hour, 1 use per day)
- **Dimensional Resonance**: All creatures in this chamber can sense the Ethereal Plane (advantage on Perception checks to detect ethereal creatures)
- **Research Notes**: Stone tablets throughout the room detail the monks' findings
- **Elevated Platforms**: Multiple observation levels connected by carved walkways
- **Construction**: _[Combination - natural cavern with extensive worked stone modifications]_

### The Research Archive

Stone tablets and preserved papers throughout the chamber contain:

- **Phase Spider Behavioral Studies**: Detailed observations of captive subjects
- **Dimensional Corruption Theory**: The monks' mistaken belief that phase spiders were "damaged"
- **Treatment Attempts**: Records of failed "healing" experiments
- **Growing Doubts**: Later notes showing uncertainty about their methods

### Major Encounter: Brother Kelmen

This chamber houses **Brother Kelmen**, the last monk who refused to flee after the catastrophe. He spent years trying to repair the damage, slowly becoming displaced between the Material and Ethereal planes.

**See "The Ethereal Echo" encounter details below**

---

## Area 18: Dimensional Breach

_Site of catastrophic ritual failure_

### Description

> This area appears as a large gap in the floor, roughly 20 feet in diameter. The edges of the opening seem to shimmer and bend strangely, defying normal perspective. The hole drops into darkness below, though occasional flashes of otherworldly light suggest something significant lies beneath. The surrounding floor shows blast patterns and areas where the stone appears to have been melted or warped.

### Features

- **Dimensional Instability**: The area within 10 feet has unpredictable magical effects
- **Perilous Descent**: The hole drops 30 feet to the Deep Meditation Chamber below
- **Reality Distortion**: The edges of the breach don't follow normal geometry
- **Energy Discharge**: Occasional bursts of dimensional energy (1d6 force damage, DC 15 Dex save to avoid)
- **Construction**: _[Dimensional anomaly - originally worked stone floor, now breached]_

### Descent Options

- **Climbing**: DC 15 Athletics check, with disadvantage due to unstable surfaces
- **Rope**: Can be secured to stable stone outside the distortion field
- **Magic**: _Feather Fall_ or similar spells work normally
- **Dangerous**: Failed descent results in 3d6 falling damage plus 1d6 force damage from dimensional energy

---

## Areas 19-20: Specimen Research Complex

_Phase spider containment and study areas_

### Area 19: Specimen Preparation Area

> This large natural cavern was adapted for some kind of systematic study or processing. Stone platforms and what appear to be restraint systems have been built into the natural formations, creating areas that seem designed for safely examining or containing something. The space feels oppressive, with an air of lingering unease.

### Area 20: Quarantine Chamber

> Connected to Area 19, this natural chamber appears to have served as some kind of holding area. Stone platforms with intricate runic circles have been carved into the floor, and the air feels heavy and constrained. Elevated observation positions have been carved into the walls, suggesting whatever was held here was watched carefully.

### Features (Both Areas)

- **Containment Infrastructure**: Stone platforms with runic circles for dimensional anchoring
- **Observation Posts**: Elevated positions for safe study
- **Restraint Systems**: Stone clamps and magical binding points
- **Dimensional Anchor Fields**: Weakened but still functional containment magic
- **Psychic Residue**: Lingering emotions of fear and confusion from trapped spiders
- **Construction**: _[Natural caverns with moderate worked stone additions]_

### Current State

- **Liberation Possible**: Dispel Magic (DC 16) or destroying rune circles disables containment
- **Remaining Captives**: 1d3 **Phase Spiders** may still be trapped in weakened fields
- **Matriarch**: Area 20 contains the ancient **Phase Spider Matriarch** (use **Phase Spider** stats but with 45 HP and Legendary Actions)

### The Matriarch

If freed, the **Phase Spider Matriarch** initially appears hostile but is actually desperate to protect any remaining offspring. She can communicate through empathic bursts (telepathy 30 feet) and will:

1. Thank liberators by gifting **Phase Spider Silk** (worth 500 gp, can be crafted into a **Cloak of Elvenkind**)
2. Share knowledge about dimensional travel (+2 bonus to Arcana checks involving planar magic for 24 hours)
3. Warn about the danger in the Deep Meditation Chamber below

---

## Area 21: Abbot's Chamber

_Combined private quarters, meeting room, and records office_

### Description

> This chamber served multiple functions for what was likely the community's leader. Personal quarters occupy one section with a large stone sleeping platform and private storage. A meeting area with stone chairs arranged in a circle provides space for group discussions. Writing desks and archive storage contain administrative materials. The chamber feels more formal than other spaces, with carefully carved decorative elements.

### Features

- **Personal Quarters**: Private sleeping area with quality furnishings
- **Meeting Circle**: Stone seats for conducting monastery business
- **Administrative Desk**: Writing surface with organizational materials
- **Record Storage**: Archive of monastery correspondence, visitor logs, and decisions
- **Formal Decoration**: More elaborate carving work than utilitarian spaces
- **Construction**: _[Worked stone - formal administrative space]_

### Administrative Records

**Investigation (DC 14)** reveals:

- **Visitor Logs**: Records of travelers who brought news of phase spider sightings
- **Correspondence**: Letters with other monasteries and scholars about dimensional phenomena
- **Decision Records**: Documentation of the choice to begin phase spider research
- **Resource Management**: Lists of supplies, food stores, and research materials

### The Final Records

**Investigation (DC 18)** uncovers:

- **Research Doubts**: Later entries questioning whether the spiders were actually suffering
- **Mental Influence Evidence**: Handwriting changes showing multiple personalities taking over
- **Final Plans**: Documentation of the catastrophic ritual attempt
- **Evacuation Orders**: Records showing some monks left before the final disaster

---

## Level 2 (Lower Level)

## Deep Meditation Chamber

_Site of the final ritual and dimensional catastrophe_

### Description

> This chamber defies normal geometry and perception. What should be a rectangular room has somehow been warped into a spherical space, 20 feet in diameter. Terraced stone platforms rise in concentric rings toward the center, where a raised dais holds the remnants of what appears to have been a complex circular pattern carved into the stone. The air thrums with an energy you can feel in your bones, and occasionally you catch glimpses of movement or scenes that seem to flicker in and out of existence. At the chamber's exact center floats a tiny, writhing knot of absolute darkness no bigger than a child's fist.

### Features

- **Spherical Geometry**: The room's shape defies its original rectangular construction
- **Astral Movement**: Movement works like the Astral Plane - characters must will themselves toward destinations
- **Temporal Echoes**: Characters occasionally glimpse scenes of the monks' final ritual
- **Planar Bleed**: Effects from multiple planes occasionally manifest randomly
- **The Aberrant Whisper**: A psychic echo of the collapsed rift floats at the center
- **Construction**: _[Dimensional anomaly - originally worked stone, now warped by planar forces]_

### Movement Mechanics

Characters must make DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) or Wisdom (Insight) checks to understand the movement system. Once learned:

- **Normal Movement**: DC 10 Wisdom save to move normally
- **Failed Save**: Move half distance in slightly wrong direction
- **Natural 1**: Move in completely wrong direction or become stuck until next turn

### The Aberrant Whisper

This tiny knot of writhing darkness is a psychic echo of the collapsed rift. Approaching within 10 feet requires a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or suffer temporary madness (roll on Short-Term Madness table). The Whisper cannot be damaged by normal means but can be contained or banished through powerful magic.

---

## Major Encounters

### The Ethereal Echo - Brother Kelmen

_Found in Area 17: Observatory Chamber_

Brother Kelmen is the last monk who refused to flee after the catastrophe. Years of exposure to dimensional instability have left him partially displaced between planes.

**Initial Appearance**: Kelmen materializes suddenly, appearing agitated and gesturing frantically. His behavior is ambiguous - players cannot initially tell if he's hostile or trying to help.

**Communication Challenge**: Kelmen speaks fragmented archaic Giant:

- _"Harm... you... I... must... stop..."_ (Could mean threat or warning)
- _"Danger... here... you... bring... death..."_ (Hostile intent or protective concern?)

**Resolution Options**:

1. **Understanding** (Intelligence DC 12 + Wisdom DC 15): Realize he's trying to help
2. **Stabilization**: Use magical items in viewing alcoves to stabilize his dimensional state
3. **Compassion**: Show kindness to phase spiders - he automatically becomes helpful

**Information Shared**: Once communication is established, Kelmen reveals:

- The truth about the monks' research and mental influence
- Warnings about the Deep Meditation Chamber
- Locations of hidden treasures and research materials
- The real story behind the monastery's fall

### Ethereal Echoes

Throughout the monastery, characters may trigger psychic impressions that replay key moments:

**Echo 1** (Area 2): A firbolg monk welcoming visitors, speaking of their "sacred mission" **Echo 2** (Area 17): Monks debating whether their subjects are truly healing or suffering **Echo 3** (Areas 19-20): The moment of realization that the spiders viewed them as captors **Echo 4** (Deep Meditation Chamber): The final ritual beginning, with monks speaking of "transcendence"

---

---

## Conclusion

The Monastery of Dimensional Harmony serves as more than a dungeon - it's a meditation on good intentions corrupted by external influence, and the importance of understanding rather than controlling what we fear. The phase spiders aren't monsters to be defeated but victims to be liberated. The true treasure lies not in gold or magic items but in the wisdom gained from understanding this ancient tragedy.

Parties that approach with violence will find dangerous enemies and modest rewards. Those who seek to understand will discover allies, knowledge, and warnings that may prove crucial in their own encounters with dimensional forces. The monastery stands as both a testament to the dangers of hubris and a source of hope that compassion can triumph over fear.
