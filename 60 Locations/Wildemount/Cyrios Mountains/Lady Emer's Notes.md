# Temporal Resonance Crystal

## Initial Discovery - Day 1

Found the artifact among the planar debris recovered from the rift near Ashkeeper Peaks. The merchant claimed it came from "somewhere in the eastern wastes" but was vague about specifics. Dodecahedral in shape, approximately 8 inches across, made of some gray crystalline material that defies easy classification. When I first touched it, I experienced what I can only describe as temporal displacement - for a moment, I was simultaneously aware of myself performing this same examination yesterday, tomorrow, and in several alternate versions of now.

**Physical Properties:**

- Weight: Approximately 15 pounds (seems heavier than dimensions suggest)
- Material: Gray translucent crystal, possibly quartz-like but with unusual internal structure
- Shape: Perfect dodecahedron with natural faceting
- Temperature: Cool to touch, maintains constant temperature regardless of environment
- Luminescence: Faint gray glow that pulses irregularly

The metal handles and golden trim were clearly added later by someone else - crude work compared to the artifact itself. I've removed them for proper study.

## Day 3 - First Magical Analysis

Cast _Detect Magic_ and nearly lost consciousness from the feedback. Whatever school this belongs to, it's not one covered in traditional magical theory. The aura is... alien. Wrong. Like trying to categorize a color that doesn't exist.

_Identify_ proved even more troublesome. The spell connected but seemed to open my mind to an infinite expanse of possibility - thousands of potential versions of this moment, each slightly different. I saw myself as human, as an elf, as a dragon, as things that have no names. Disturbing but fascinating.

**Hypothesis:** This artifact operates on principles of temporal and probability manipulation rather than traditional elemental or divine magic.

## Day 7 - Dead Ends

My research into the crystal's origins has proven frustratingly fruitless. The few texts I've found that might reference similar artifacts are either damaged, incomplete, or written in scripts I can't decipher. One fragmentary passage from a Savalir Wood ruin mentions "gray stones that anchor time's flow," but the context is unclear.

_(Several paragraphs of complaints about "unreliable sources" and "primitive record-keeping in frontier regions" follow)_

**Key Discovery:** When I focus on the crystal for extended periods, I gain what I can only call "probability fragments" - brief moments where I can slightly alter chance outcomes. I successfully influenced the outcome of three coin tosses yesterday, and managed to ensure my basilisk struck exactly where I intended during feeding time.

More importantly, I've noticed the crystal reacts to proximity of my planar specimens. When placed near materials from the Feywild or Elemental Planes, both the crystal and the planar materials exhibit increased magical resonance.

## Day 12 - Temporal Displacement Effects

The crystal's effects on time are more pronounced than I initially realized. I've been experiencing what I can only describe as "temporal echoes" - brief glimpses of moments that feel like memories but cannot be mine. Most are mundane scenes of people I don't recognize in places I've never been.

_(Three pages of rambling speculation about "dimensional consciousness bleeding" and "cross-planar memory contamination" that make little sense)_

**Critical Observation:** The crystal seems to anchor local time flow while somehow existing partially outside normal temporal constraints. This may be exactly what I need for my planar rift stabilization work.

## Day 18 - The Eastern Connection

I've managed to track down a few more rumors about similar artifacts. A trader from Port Zoon claims the dark-skinned peoples of the far eastern wastelands possess "magic stones that bring back the dead," but such tales are likely exaggerated folklore. _(Several paragraphs dismissing "barbarian superstitions" and "primitive ritual practices")_

**However:** If the crystal can affect probability and time, could it theoretically influence life force patterns? Not actual resurrection, obviously, but perhaps some form of temporal preservation or enhancement?

**Practical Note:** The crystal's temporal stabilization properties might be exactly what Vaud needs for his portal work. I should consider what he might trade for access to it.

---

## Day 25 - Integration Experiments

Attempted to combine the crystal's effects with a minor planar rift. **Results were immediate and dramatic.** The rift, which had been chaotically fluctuating between Material and Elemental Air, stabilized completely while the crystal was active nearby.

**Distance testing results:**

- 10 feet: Complete stabilization
- 30 feet: Significant reduction in temporal flux
- 60 feet: Minor stabilization
- 100 feet: No discernible effect

This suggests the crystal creates some kind of "temporal anchor field" with roughly 50-foot effective radius.

**Troubling observation:** During the experiment, I began experiencing what I can only describe as "temporal displacement sickness" - nausea, disorientation, and the persistent feeling that I was experiencing events several seconds out of sync with reality.

---

## Day 30 - Theoretical Frameworks

I've been studying the relationship between planar energy and temporal stability, and I believe this crystal represents only one component of a larger magical system. My readings of pre-Calamity texts suggest ancient magical workings required both chaotic energy sources and stabilizing elements to function safely.

**Theory:** This crystal provides temporal stabilization, but without a corresponding energy-channeling component, major planar workings would remain impossible. The ancients understood something about magical balance that we've forgotten.

**Critical Question:** Are there other similar artifacts? The crystal's perfect construction suggests it was part of a series or set, not a unique creation.

_(Several pages contain increasingly technical speculation about "temporal resonance networks" and "planar energy matrices" with diagrams that seem based more on wishful thinking than observation)_

---

## Day 35 - Growing Concerns

The temporal displacement effects are intensifying. I'm experiencing sensations and memories that feel real but cannot be mine - conversations in languages I don't speak, landscapes I've never seen, emotions tied to events that never happened to me. Sometimes I lose track of which thoughts are actually my own.

**Urgent observation:** The crystal's pulsing has become more frequent and intense. During my experiments yesterday, I could swear I heard something like whispers coming from within the stone itself - not in any language I recognize, but somehow conveying meaning nonetheless.

I should probably discontinue the experiments, but the potential applications are too important. If this truly is a temporal anchoring device, it could revolutionize planar research. No more catastrophic rift collapses, no more temporal cascade failures...

But I suspect I need additional components to achieve anything beyond stabilization. The energy channeling element, whatever form it takes.

**Note:** Must investigate whether the Cerberus Assembly has encountered similar artifacts in their excavations. It is entirely possible this technology is pre-Calamity in origin.

## Final Entry - Day 38

Something is definitely wrong with prolonged exposure to this artifact. The whispers are constant now, and I frequently catch myself responding to them as if they were actual conversations. The temporal echoes have become so vivid that I sometimes forget which timeline I'm actually inhabiting.

**Important discovery:** The crystal responds dramatically to the presence of other powerful magical artifacts. When I brought it near my collection of planar fragments, both resonated with unusual intensity. This suggests the crystal might be designed to work in conjunction with other specific magical devices.

**Conclusion:** This artifact is clearly ancient, sophisticated, and potentially dangerous. Its temporal anchoring properties make it invaluable for planar research, but its mental effects suggest it was never meant for prolonged individual use.

I need to either find the missing components that would allow proper utilization, or consider trading it to someone better equipped to handle its complexities.
