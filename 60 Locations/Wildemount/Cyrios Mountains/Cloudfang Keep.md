When Lady Emer was human, she excelled as a scout in the mercenary Emissaries of the Sunfall. During her travels, she encountered a planar rift and became fascinated by the raw, chaotic energy it contained. She began experimenting with planar magic, seeking to understand its nature and harness its power. Her experiments led to her transformation into a medusa, a change she embraced as a step closer to understanding the fundamental forces of reality.

Emer now seeks to master planar magic, driven by a thirst for knowledge and the potential for immense power. She believes the Lorestone shards are keys to unlocking the secrets of the planes and controlling the rifts that scar Exandria.

[[Lady Emer]] is a planar magic expert working with Vaud Qalix and Dreyara Drimvar. She uses [[Cloudfang Keep]] as a base of operations for studying planar rifts and researching the Lorestone shards. She provides Qalix with arcane expertise and a secure location for experimentation.

# Keep Features

Unless otherwise noted, each area of Cloud Fang Keep has the following features:

> Ceilings. The stone ceilings are 60 feet high. The ceilings in each chamber have been patched up, but the halls still have holes that allow snow into the keep.

> Doors. Lady Emer has removed all the keep’s interior doors and replaced them with heavy velvet curtains that muffle sound. Stone doors lead into the entrance hall (area E1) from outside, and every area adjoining the stone garden (area E5) has stone doors leading to it. Doors and doorways are 10 feet high.

> Illumination. Low-burning lanterns fill the halls with dim light. Chandeliers enchanted with permanent dancing lights spells provide colorful dim light in each chamber.

>Walls. Climbing the walls of the keep without equipment requires a successful DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check. If the check fails by 5 or more, the wall crumbles when the creature is halfway to their destination and they fall.

# Guardians

Lady Emer cares for several creatures who serve as her guards and pets. They are trained to attack intruders and to alert her to invited guests.

## Defeated Guardians
Unless otherwise noted, if the keep’s guardians are clearly losing a battle to intruders, they flee to warn Lady Emer in the library (area E6). If she has been warned of intruders, Lady Emer moves to the stone garden (area E5) and sends the guardians who warned her to patrol the perimeter of the keep.

## Defeated Characters
Lady Emer’s guardians try to keep defeated characters alive and bring them to Lady Emer, who petrifies her prisoners and displays them in the stone garden (area E5). 

# Resting in Cloud Fang Keep 
Once an area is clear of enemies, the characters can take a short rest there uninterrupted. If the characters take a long rest in the lair while Lady Emer is alive, there is a 50 percent chance she finds them 1 hour into the long rest.

# Entering Cloud Fang Keep
Perched atop Frigid Summit, Cloud Fang Keep is 23,421 feet above sea level. The area outside the lair is a high altitude and extreme cold environment. You can find rules for these adventure environments in the game’s core rules.

The crumbling castle’s stone double doors are flanked by two trained owlbears disguised as statues thanks to an illusion created by the castle. If the characters observe the castle from a distance for at least 5 minutes before entering, they notice that another four owlbears patrol the castle’s perimeter, while four griffons patrol the skies and occasionally visit a nest atop the ruined tower.

As the party approaches the castle, characters who succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notice the owlbear statues twitching and breathing; otherwise, they are surprised when the owlbears attack. When the characters come within 30 feet of the owlbears, the owlbears attack and the statue illusion ends. At the start of the second round of combat, the four owlbears on patrol join the fray. A blood-borne ooze emerges from the first two owlbears to die.

At the start of the fourth round of combat, a griffon from the roost (area E2) swoops down and joins the fray. The griffon tries to capture a character and bring them back to the roost.

### Blood-Borne Oozes
For convenience, the blood-borne oozes simply emerge from the owlbears when they die. However, for more unpredictability, you can have each ooze make a Constitution saving throw whenever an owlbear takes 5 or more damage, per their Pseudopod attack.

# Cloud Fang Keep Areas
The following areas are keyed to the Cloud Fang Keep Map.

## E1. Entrance Hall
The chandelier in this hall glows brighter than the others, filling the chamber with bright light. The entrance hall has the following features:
- “Moldy, faded tapestries decorate this welcome hall that smells of animal musk and a faint whiff of ozone.”
- “A pile of animal bones and refuse sits in the northeast corner of the room. It is clearly the source of the odor.”
- (Secret) Blood-borne oozes hide in the refuse pile.
- (Secret) The tapestries hide crumbling walls and are covered in toxic mold.

### Moldy Tapestries
A character who examines a tapestry and succeeds on a DC 17 Intelligence (Nature) check discovers it is covered in flemgot, a mind-altering mold that weakens Humanoids who inhale it. Each Humanoid who spends longer than 1 minute in this room must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned in this way, they have vulnerability to poison damage and have disadvantage on saving throws made to avoid or end the frightened condition on themself. A creature who succeeds on this saving throw is immune to the effects of flemgot for 24 hours.

### Owlbear Nest
The refuse pile is a nest for the owlbears who patrol. Made of bones, feathers, and pieces of destroyed leather armor, it is filled with bloody bones, rusty blades, and hidden treasure (see below).

A creature who succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check before touching the nest notices the three blood-borne oozes hiding inside it. The oozes ambush any creature who investigates the nest, but otherwise remain there. They owe no loyalty to Lady Emer and don’t warn her of intruders.

### Treasure
A creature who searches the owlbear nest and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check find a silver necklace (worth 15 gp) and ten crossbow bolts.

## E2. Griffon Roost
Spiral stairs lead 120 feet to the top of this tower where the griffons roost. On the top floor, the tower’s walls and ceiling have been removed, exposing it to the outside. As the characters make their way upstairs, they can hear the griffons move and squawk around overhead.

The roost has the following features:
- “The stairs emerge into the middle of a gigantic nest made of wet branches and filled with bones and feathers. The walls and ceiling are gone, exposing the nest to the sky.”
- “Two enormous griffons sit in the nest, tearing apart a stag carcass as they devour chunks of its flesh.”
- “A gray-speckled egg as wide as a wagon wheel sits on the west edge of the nest.”
- (Secret) More griffons are in the sky, returning from a hunt.
- (Secret) The wyvern lounging in the central courtyard can be spotted by a creature on the northeast edge of the nest.

### Nest
The nest is difficult terrain for non-griffon creatures.

### Griffons
A family of four griffons patrol the castle and serve as Lady Emer’s mounts and guardians. Two griffons are in the nest when the characters arrive. Another two in the sky return to the nest at the start of the second round of combat. Only one griffon arrives as reinforcements if the characters have already defeated a griffon (see “Entering Cloud Fang Keep”).

If the characters outnumber the griffons, the griffons try to pick up and drop foes to the ground or use Buffet to push them off the tower. While foes remain in the nest, the griffons ignore foes outside the nest. If the griffons outnumber the characters, they engage in melee, hoping to kill the intruders quickly and devour their bodies.

The griffons fight to the death to defend their nest and don’t pursue enemies who retreat inside the castle.

### Wyvern Below
A creature who looks over the side of the nest and into the stone garden (area E5) can see the wyvern lounging on the pillar.

### Treasure
The 200-pound egg is a griffon egg (see “Lady Emer’s Hoard”). A creature who spends at least 5 minutes picking through the bones in the nest finds a bag of ball bearings, a bag of caltrops, and a flask of alchemist’s fire wrapped in leather.

## E3. Storage Room
This area has the following features:
- “Porcelain dust fills the air, and the room smells faintly of garlic and dust.”
- “Crates stand in neat stacks along the east wall while broken statuary lies in piles across the floor.”
- Planar materials lie in piles across the floor. A DC 10 Intelligence(Investigation) check reveals the following:
	- Crystals from the Elemental Plane of Earth
	- Petrified wood from the Feywild
	- One broken statue is clearly not of Exandrian origin and demonstrates some of the same signs of corruption seen at the Pier.
- (Secret) Lady Emer’s basilisks sleep amid the rubble on the west wall.
- (Secret) Rubble hides a trapped glyph on the ground in the south doorway.

### Rubble-Strewn Floor
The rubble is difficult terrain for creatures who walk on four or fewer legs. (The basilisks have eight legs.)

### Basilisks
Blinkers and Blunders are Lady Emer’s prized pet basilisks. Each wears a dragon-scale collar with a gold name tag. A creature who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 17 or higher notices the basilisks sleeping among the rubble and spots their shiny collars. If the characters succeed on a DC 12 group Dexterity (Stealth) check, they can sneak through the room without waking the basilisks. A character who succeeds on a DC 17 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check can remove a basilisk’s collar without waking the creature.

### Trapped Glyph
The rubble-covered glyph is a trap created by the illusionist who lived in the keep. Lady Emer and her guardians know about the trap and only use the north entrance to the room. A creature who succeeds on a DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check notices the glyph on the ground. A detect magic spell reveals the glyph’s aura of illusion magic.

When a creature passes over the glyph, it erupts with magical energy. Each creature within 10 feet of the room’s south entrance sees an illusion of what they fear most and must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute or until that creature takes damage. While frightened by this magic, a creature must scream loudly (which wakes the basilisks) and run in a clockwise circuit around the lair (from area E3 to E4 to E6, and so on), moving their full speed and taking the Dash action each turn. Once the glyph triggers, it can’t trigger again for 24 hours.

If the glyph loses its magic, it can no longer trigger and the frightened condition ends for all creatures affected by the trap. Treat the glyph as a 4th-level spell for the purpose of dispel magic or similar effects. A creature can make a DC 17 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to scratch out the glyph. On a successful check, the glyph loses its magic; otherwise, the trap triggers.

### Treasure
The crates contain a pouch containing 200 gp and enough food and water to sustain a Medium creature for 90 days. The basilisk collars are worth 150 gp each.

## E4. Grand Salon
This area has a 30-foot-high ceiling and the following features:
- “Shimmering lights from three chandeliers illuminate a stained-glass ceiling that depicts suns, moons, and planets. The reflections of the chandelier and stained glass gleam on a polished marble floor with a wide space for dancing.”
- “The chamber’s northwest corner holds comfortable couches and a side table with decorative ashtrays.”
- “The northeast corner is set with four wooden chairs next to a harpsichord. Musical instruments sit on each chair.”
- “Two glass-and-marble display cases filled with glittering treasures stand against the south wall.”
- A DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check reveals that the ceiling is not the Exandrian sky.
- (Secret) The ceiling can create a mesmerizing illusion when a creature tampers with the display cases.

### Display Case Trap
Lady Emer uses the keep’s trapped display cases to keep her treasures safe. A detect magic spell reveals auras of illusion magic on the display cases, the chandeliers, and the ceiling.

The cases are locked, and Lady Emer carries a key. A display case’s glass top has AC 13, 9 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A creature can pick the lock with a successful DC 18 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. If this check fails or if a display’s glass is broken, the trap triggers.

When the trap triggers, the chandeliers put on a brilliant light display as the stained-glass images dance enthrallingly for 1 minute. For the duration, when a creature who can see the floor or ceiling starts their turn, they must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage and be incapacitated until the start of their next turn.

Treat the trap as a 4th-level spell for the purpose of dispel magic or similar effects. Destroying all three chandeliers ends the effect early. Each 10-foot-diameter chandelier has AC 13, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. When a chandelier is destroyed, it falls to the ground. Each creature beneath a chandelier when it falls must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Treasure
The items in the room and its display cases are Lady Emer’s hoard. See “Lady Emer’s Hoard” for more information.

## E5. Stone Garden
The stone garden is an outdoor courtyard at the center of the keep. It has the following features: 
- “Fragrant flowers and herbs decorate the six statues standing in this courtyard. These verdant splashes of life fail to conceal the terror depicted on each stone face.”
- “At the center of the garden, towering above the statues, an enormous marble pedestal encased in flowering vines rises 40 feet into the air.”
- (Secret) Atop the pedestal sits a wyvern.
- (Secret) If Lady Emer has been warned about intruders (see “Guardians”), she hides atop the pedestal.

### Wyvern
A wyvern surveys the garden. Hot-tempered and bored, her only entertainment is poisoning trespassers moments before Lady Emer or her basilisks petrify them. The wyvern waits for intruders to near the center of the courtyard then attacks, making ample use of her Bite and Stinger attacks. She enjoys flying up to the pedestal with grappled creatures and flinging them off using Tail Sweep, then picking them up after they hit the ground with another Bite attack.

### Lady Emer
If Lady Emer is here, she views the characters as a threat. She attacks from atop the pedestal, using the height to her advantage. Until her death, her arrogance makes her believe she can beat any opponent.

### Poisonous Plants
Characters who succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check know the plants in this garden thrive at high altitudes and many are poisonous. A character who is proficient with alchemist’s supplies, herbalism kits, or poisoner’s kits knows which plants are most useful for alchemical purposes and can spend 10 minutes gathering blossoms to make one dose of each of the following poisons: assassin’s blood, malice, and oil of taggit. That character can then spend 1 hour during a short or long rest to create a dose of one of those poisons. 

### Statues
The statues in the garden are petrified adventurers who came to the castle seeking treasure or the death of Lady Emer. Each is a retainer who can serve the characters if freed:
- Alia Sylf: A human mercenary
- Gorith Tork: An orc blacksmith
- Kaxor: A lizardfolk hunter
- Septima Vinculum: A kobold decanus
- [[Varnes Dwell]]: A hobgoblin tactician
- Worjo: A minotaur devastator
- Orgor: a Githzerai monk

### Climbable Vines
The sturdy vines growing on the pedestal can be climbed without an ability check.

### Treasure
Lady Emer carries a key to the display cases in the grand salon (area E4).

## E6. Library
The library has the following features:
- “Warm light illuminates walls lined with shelf after shelf of books. On the west side of the room, a desk sits piled high with assorted papers, an inkpot, a penknife, and dozens of quills. A bed stands in the southeast corner.”
- (If Lady Emer is here) “Coiled over the desk in a pose of frustration, a medusa exasperatedly crosses out something with a quill and breaks its nib. Without missing a beat, one of the snakes that comprises her hair places another freshly inked quill in her hand.”

### Lady Emer
How Lady Emer handles the characters depends on how they enter the library. If they arrive with weapons drawn, screaming in fear due to the storage room’s trap (area E3), or covered in her guardians’ blood, she attacks, moving into the stone garden (area E5) where she can maneuver freely and fuel her Stone Sacrifice trait with the garden statues.

If the characters arrive in a friendly manner, Lady Emer takes the opportunity to chat. A notoriously deadly and vain assassin, Lady Emer prefers conversations that are short, exciting, and flattering. She is quick to turn her Stone Gaze on anyone who bores or insults her.

If a character praises Lady Emer’s skill as an assassin, extols a love of literature, or claims to know secrets that could help the medusa ascend to godhood, they can make a DC 19 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check. On a success, Lady Emer invites the characters to stay for a party. If they agree, she leads them to the grand salon (area E4), where she plays the harpsichord for them and encourages them to dance. If the characters don’t play along, Lady Emer attacks. If the characters do as she asks, Lady Emer thanks them for their time and conversation, then asks them to leave so she can rest. At your discretion, characters who are particularly engaged receive an item from her hoard (see “Lady Emer’s Hoard”) as a gift and are invited for a return visit.

### Lair Actions
When fighting inside her lair, Lady Emer can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), she can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; she can’t use the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- Shadowstep. Emer teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space she can see.
- Stony Wail. The statues in Emer’s lair scream in pain. Each enemy within 60 feet of Emer who can hear the statues must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of Emer until the end of initiative count 20 on the next round.
- Venom Shower. Black venom rains down in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point Emer can see within 90 feet of her. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of initiative count 20 on the next round.

### Books
Lady Emer’s books consist mainly of tomes about religious and magical lore.

### Treasure
Lady Emer’s desk holds hundreds of poorly written poems, twelve owlbear-feather quills, twelve griffon-feather quills, and inkpots with black, gold, green, and purple ink. The set of quills and inks is worth 50 gp. The desk drawers contain a disguise kit, a forgery kit, a set of mason’s tools, a poisoner’s kit, a set of thieves’ tools, and a pouch containing 3,130 gp. Lady Emer carries a key to the display cases in the grand salon (area E4).

### Stone Chest

> A rectangular stone chest sits prominently on a reinforced shelf, carved from the same dark stone as the keep's construction. The lid features an elaborate relief carving of Lady Emer's face in her current medusa form - serpentine hair writhing around a beautiful but cold visage. Her eyes are inlaid with polished obsidian stones that seem to gleam with inner light regardless of the room's illumination. The carving shows remarkable detail, from the scales on her snake-hair to the slight curve of her lips, as if she were about to speak.
> 
> Around the edge of the lid, carved in flowing Draconic script, are the words: _"Stone eyes see, but do stone ears hear?"_

#### Mechanics

**Lock Mechanism**:

- Both obsidian eyes must be pressed simultaneously
- The Draconic passphrase _"Stone hearts beat with temporal rhythm"_ must be spoken while pressing the eyes
- The eyes require firm, deliberate pressure - a casual touch won't activate them

**Discovery**:

- **DC 12 Investigation**: Reveals the Draconic inscription around the lid's edge
- **DC 15 Investigation**: Notices that the obsidian eyes can be depressed slightly, suggesting they're meant to be pressed
- Anyone who has read Lady Emer's poetry and succeeds on a **DC 10 Intelligence check** recognizes the "stone" theme connection to her poems

**Trap** (Wrong passphrase, no passphrase, or pressing eyes without speaking):

#### Trap Activation

> The obsidian eyes suddenly flash with brilliant light. The person touching the chest must immediately make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, gray stone begins creeping up their arms from where they touched the eyes, and they become paralyzed as partial petrification sets in.
> 
> Simultaneously, the carved mouth snaps open with an audible crack, revealing rows of stone teeth. A piercing, inhuman shriek erupts from the opening - a sound like grinding stone mixed with a serpent's hiss that seems to reverberate through your very bones.

**Trap Effects**:

- **Primary target**: DC 15 Constitution save or paralyzed for 1 minute (can repeat save at end of each turn)
- **All creatures in room**: DC 13 Constitution save or stunned until end of their next turn
- **Alert**: The shriek can be heard throughout the keep and will draw any remaining guardians

#### Successful Opening

> As you speak the Draconic phrase and press the obsidian eyes, they sink smoothly into the carved face with a soft _click_. The mouth curves into what might almost be a satisfied smile, and the lid swings open with a whisper of well-oiled hinges.
> 
> Inside, nestled in black velvet padding, lies a gray crystalline dodecahedron approximately eight inches across. The artifact pulses with a faint, undulating light that seems to shift and flow beneath its translucent surface. Even at rest, the crystal emanates an almost tangible sense of temporal weight - as if it exists slightly out of step with the normal flow of time.
> 
> Beneath the crystal, you can see the edge of leather-bound journal pages covered in Lady Emer's precise handwriting.

**Contents**:

- The [[luxon-beacon-egw|Luxon Beacon]]
- Lady Emer's [[Lady Emer's Notes|research notes]] on the "Temporal Resonance Crystal"
- A small silk pouch containing an emerald, a sapphire, and a black pearl, each worth 100 gp. This is her "emergency fund".

#### DM Notes

- The passphrase must be spoken in Draconic for the mechanism to work
- Players can find the passphrase in Lady Emer's poetry collection scattered throughout her library
- The "Stone eyes see, but do stone ears hear?" inscription serves as her personal mnemonic to remember the "Stone hearts beat with temporal rhythm" passphrase
- If players attempt to break the chest open by force, treat it as AC 17, 50 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage
- The trap resets after 24 hours if not properly opened

## E7. Parlor
This area has the following features:
- “Overstuffed armchairs sit among side tables set with vases holding roses.”
- “An empty crystal decanter, matching goblets, and bottles of wine sit on a buffet table against the south wall.”
- “Beneath a hole in the keep’s ceiling, a pile of snow lies against the east wall.”
- (Secret) The snow pile is enchanted to animate and attack intruders.

### Living Snow
Illusion magic in the keep’s walls has seeped into the pile of snow. A creature who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 18 or higher notices the snow shifting unnaturally. When a Humanoid touches the snow, it reforms into a duplicate of that Humanoid. The duplicate uses the same statistics as the Humanoid, except it is a Construct. The duplicate has mundane copies of the Humanoid’s equipment and is hostile to the Humanoid and their allies. The duplicate attacks, fighting until destroyed. When the duplicate is destroyed, its body and equipment melt into a puddle of water. There is only enough snow to form one duplicate.

If combat breaks out in the parlor while Lady Emer is in the library (area E6), she arrives at the start of the third round of combat.

### Treasure
The parlor holds four porcelain vases (worth 20 gp each), a crystal decanter and six crystal goblets (worth 50 gp as a set), and six bottles of aged fine wine (worth 20 gp each).

## Lady Emer’s Hoard
Lady Emer’s grand salon (area E4) contains the bulk of her assassination trophies, and the griffon roost (area E2) holds a griffon egg. The hoard includes the following items:
- Bag of beans
- Pair of winged boots
- Ring of mind shielding
- Wand of restoration (see below)
- Dust of disappearance
- Potion of gaseous form
- Potion of heroism
- 2 potions of poison
- 5 bottles of serpent venom
- Lyre (worth 30 gp)
- 2 viols (worth 30 gp each)
- Ornate crystal flute (worth 350 gp)
- Heavy ebony crossbow with gold filigree (worth 1,500 gp)

### Griffon Egg
This 3-foot-diameter, 4-foot-high egg weighs 200 pounds. After 1d6 weeks, a Medium baby griffon noncombatant hatches from the egg. After 1 year, the creature becomes a griffon companion. The GM can advance or slow this timeline to suit the campaign’s pacing.

### Wand of Restoration
Wand, Rare (Requires Attunement)

This wand has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 2 of its charges to cast the lesser restoration spell from it, or 4 charges to cast the greater restoration spell from it.

The wand regains 1d4 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.
