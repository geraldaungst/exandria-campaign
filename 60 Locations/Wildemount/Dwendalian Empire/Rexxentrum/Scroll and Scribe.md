The shop is a haven for those who appreciate the art of writing. Rows of parchment, vellum, and fine paper greet you as you enter, while a variety of quills and inks are displayed on a large table in the center. The atmosphere is quiet, with the only sounds being the scratching of a quill and the occasional laughter of the tall half-orc woman sitting at a workbench in the back corner of the shop.

Detailed Description:

Scroll & Scribe is a small but well-organized shop specializing in high-quality writing supplies. The proprietor is [[Dalina Van DeVries]]. The walls are painted in a calming shade of blue, adorned with framed calligraphy samples showcasing the different inks and parchments available. The shelves are filled with an assortment of papers, from simple sheets to luxurious vellum and illuminated manuscripts.

A large, central table displays a variety of quills, ink bottles, and writing tools, inviting customers to test and compare. Dalina's workspace is tucked in a corner, where she can often be found crafting custom orders or experimenting with new ink formulas. Her dark brown hair, often pushed back with a leather headband, cascades over her shoulders as she works.

In the center of the back wall, a well-camouflaged door opens to reveal a staircase that leads down to a small, well lit cellar. A DC 17 Investigation or DC 20 Perception check reveals that the table in front of this door does not quite touch the floor. It is in fact attached to the door and it swings out when the door is opened. This hidden space serves as a meeting room for the Emissaries of the Sunfall, complete with a heavy wooden table, old maps, and scrolls detailing their plans and secrets.
