# Core Information
## The True History of [[Celdric Ambril|Celunor]] and His Shop
[[Celdric Ambril]] was no archivist in a grand library, but rather a savvy collector and trader of rare books. He spent years traveling across continents, collecting tomes, scrolls, and artifacts from various cultures and civilizations, some of which were indeed rare and potentially valuable to the right buyer. Eventually, he settled in [[Port Damali]], a bustling port city that offered a steady stream of travelers, scholars, and collectors—his ideal clientele.

Instead of a library reclaimed from the depths, his shop—_Celunor’s Collection_—is a peculiar establishment located near the docks, designed to mimic the atmosphere of a submerged archive. He achieved this by decorating the place with salvaged ship parts, maritime artifacts, and cleverly placed water features that give the illusion of being underwater. Dim lighting and bottles filled with strange curiosities line the shelves alongside the books, all to give the impression of ancient depth and mystery.
### [[Celdric Ambril|Celunor]]’s Role in the Community
Despite the falsehoods and theatrics, [[Celdric Ambril|Celdric]] does provide a valuable service to [[Port Damali]]. His shop has become a haven for knowledge seekers and a center for cultural exchange. His genuine expertise in history and the arcane is respected by those who can see past the persona of [[Celdric Ambril|Celunor]].

Furthermore, [[Celdric Ambril|Celunor]] has become a bit of a local celebrity, with his exaggerated persona lending a certain charm to the district where his shop is located. In turn, his success has helped the surrounding businesses thrive, as people flock to see the famed Drowned Library and its enigmatic curator.

[[Celdric Ambril|Celdric]]’s dual life as [[Celdric Ambril|Celunor]] the Tidebound is a testament to his understanding of human nature: people love a good story, and he has plenty to sell.

### The Marketing of the Myth
[[Celdric Ambril|Celdric]], as [[Celdric Ambril|Celunor]], weaves fantastic stories about each item he sells. He claims that some books are salvaged from underwater wrecks and lost cities, while others contain knowledge so profound that they were almost lost to the ages. This storytelling has become part of the shopping experience at _Celunor’s Collection_, and people come as much for the tales as they do for the merchandise.

[[Celdric Ambril|Celdric]] also occasionally "discovers" new parts of his "sunken" collection, creating events that bring in more customers. He releases maps and riddles hinting at new acquisitions, building hype and anticipation. The real story behind each item is often much less fantastical, usually being a case of [[Celdric Ambril|Celdric]] finding them through his extensive network of suppliers or at auctions, but the patrons of his shop don’t need to know that.
