# Core Information
## Legend of the Drowned Library
The origin of the Drowned Library dates back to an age of great arcane achievements. It was constructed as a massive undertaking by a cabal of wizards who wished to create the most extensive collection of arcane knowledge the world had ever seen, including forbidden knowledge that was deemed too dangerous or powerful for the world at large.

These wizards were part of a larger magical society that thrived during a period of relative peace and prosperity, and their works were supported by various patrons, including nobles, scholars, and other mages who wished to see the bounds of magical knowledge expanded. The library was as much a symbol of their ambition as it was a vault for their secrets.

### Catastrophe and Aftermath
As the years passed, the library grew in fame and content, but it also became a target for those who wished to use its knowledge for nefarious purposes. The disaster that led to its sinking is shrouded in mystery—some say it was a natural calamity, while others whisper of a curse brought on by the hubris of the wizards or by a vindictive entity that coveted the library's secrets.

When the cataclysm struck, the library was protected by potent magics that preserved its contents against the ravaging of time and water, though it could not protect itself from submersion. As it sank, the magic that protected the books and scrolls also sealed the library, making it accessible only to those who know the right rituals or who possess the keys to its watery gates.

### The Library Today
Now, the Drowned Library is a place of legend, its exact location lost to the world, with only fragments of maps and cryptic riddles hinting at its resting place. It is said that the library contains knowledge that could bring about a second calamity or prevent one, and its submerged halls are patrolled by guardians created by [[Celdric Ambril|Celunor]]’s magic, ensuring that only the worthy—or the foolhardy—dare to seek out the Drowned Library and its secrets.
