Caes Mosor was the central tower of the elven city of [[Ruins of Molaesmyr|Molaesmyr]]. It was both the seat of government and the center of learning, housing a great library, a university, and the  Senate of [[Ruins of Molaesmyr|Molaesmyr]].

## Senate of [[Ruins of Molaesmyr|Molaesmyr]]
The Senate was the central governing body of the city. It was composed of a group of elves that varied in size, ranging from as few as 3 to as many as 17 at one point in its history. Most often the Senate had 5 to 7 members. Senators were appointed by members of a nominating committee, ostensibly elected by citizens from various districts within the city, but in fact the committee members purchased their seats from the current Senate, and the selection of senators was almost always based on who gifted the committee members with the most money and favors.

The Senators did not lead the city full time. The city had an extensive and well-functioning bureaucracy that ran the day to day operations and even much of the routine legal and diplomatic matters. The Senate met as often as needed to discuss things that could not be left to bureaucrats or over which the Senators wanted to maintain direct control.
