The Labyrinth did not begin as a maze. The tower of [[Caes Mosor (Today)|Caes Mosor]] was situated on a spot where ley energy was consistently strong. Scholars believe it is a very rare stable area they called a "lay anchor" which remains in place even as the ley lines shift around it. While the tower itself contained the public and showy spaces of the university, library, and government, the magic-rich caverns beneath the tower were cleared and converted to spaces dedicated to research and development.

Since the structure expanded organically rather than via a coherent plan, it quickly acquired a reputation for being confusing. New research assistants took to calling it "the labyrinth" as a joke, and the name stuck.

Over hundreds of years, as the underground structure expanded outward and downward, it became even more maze-like, though scholars at the time debated whether the builders were influenced subconsciously (or some argued, intentionally) by the name and reputation to make it more complicated than it needed to be. Regardless, by the time of the [[Rupture of the Molaesmyr Fey Crossing|cataclysm]] the underground rooms and tunnels were a legitimate maze and there were very few who knew even half of it.
