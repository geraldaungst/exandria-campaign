Today Caes Mosor, like the rest of [[Ruins of Molaesmyr|Molaesmyr]], is a ruined shell of its [[Caes Mosor (Historical)|former glory]]. The tower remains standing and is surprisingly intact considering the ravages of time. The tower has eleven levels. They are listed here according to their original purpose, though today they are mostly empty and overgrown:
## 1. Ground floor
This level contained the entry foyer and reception area for visitors.
## 2. University
This level includes a lecture hall and classrooms for the university
## 3. Laboratories
Basic laboratories for the university
## 4. Faculty Quarters

## 5. Library
This level housed the core collection. Little remains today. Most books were salvaged or looted over the centuries. The remaining few items are in decaying tatters.
## 6. Library
This level housed the rare books and restricted access. It is entirely devoid of all scraps of paper. There is one magically sealed and hidden room. If players manage to locate it AND get inside (very unlikely) they will find a fairly intact set of handwritten notebooks, carefully dated and organized, with the notes of [[Ilixidor Alo]]'s research into the Fey Crossing beneath the city.
## 7. Low level government functions
This level handled daily city operations.
## 8. Low level government functions
This level managed communications, planning, and oversight functions of government.
## 9. Upper level government functions
On this level were the city treasury (though treasure storage was elsewhere in [[Ruins of Molaesmyr|Molaesmyr]]), military, and diplomatic personnel
## 10. Library
This level housed special collections of interest to Senators. 
## 11. Senate
This level had the Senate meeting chamber, and also contained several workspaces where Senators held meetings and did business.
