Almost 300 years ago, at the height of [[Ruins of Molaesmyr|Molaesmyr]]'s grandeur, an elven sorcerer named [[Ilixidor Alo]] was exploring [[The Labyrinth]] beneath the tower of [[Caes Mosor (Historical)]] with the goal of expanding it and finding new opportunities. Ilixidor discovered a previously unknown Fey Crossing in an underground cavern which led to a similar cavern in the Feywild. The parallel location was hidden below ground in the Feywild making it an ideal way to travel there without being discovered by authorities on either plane. The caverns on the Fey side of the Crossing were beneath a thick jungle at the joining of two rivers.

Ilixidor assembled a team from the University to study the Crossing. He found powerful arcane magic energy concentrated on the Fey side of the portal, and sought a way to make it permanent so that the [[Ruins of Molaesmyr|Molaesmyr]] University might benefit from studying and using it.

What he did not know was that the caverns on the Fey side were ultimately connected with the Feydark and eventually the underground city of Mag Tureah. Ilixidor and his team never discovered this connection, but the Feydark was in fact the source of the magic.

In 585 PD, fomorians from Mag Tureah discovered the permanent portal. When they tried to step through to the material plane, the ancient curse that still haunts them reacted with whatever magic Ilixidor used to maintain the crossing, rupturing the Crossing further and causing the Cataclysm that began spreading the magical curse through [[Caes Mosor (Today)|Caes Mosor]], then all of [[Ruins of Molaesmyr|Molaesmyr]], and eventually the Veluthil Forest (later renamed the Savalirwood).

The cataclysm caused the portal rupture to make passage extremely dangerous (most creatures that passed through afterwards were killed or disintegrated), but it has become a siphon of sorts drawing magical energy in both directions: the cursed magic from the fomorians is drawn through to Exandria while the pure magic of Exandria pours into the Feywild. The leak is slow but steady, and over 250 years the curse has spread widely through the Savalirwood.

Unfortunately for both planes, the rupture also tore a passage through to the Astral plane where it drifts the Astral Sea, occasionally colliding with color pools that create a temporary but direct connection from more distant planes.

## Spreading Rifts
The spread of the otherworldly magic in each plane has also resulted in the appearance of harmonic rifts in the region affected by the curse. The harmonic rifts are usually brief and small, lasting a few seconds and measuring no more than a few inches. Occasionally larger and longer-lasting rifts may occur, and it is through these that cursed fey creatures (and occasionally creatures from other planes via the Astral Sea) have come through and now roam the Savalirwood. The curse also affects local animal and plant life, corrupting and changing it.

Recently, [[Erma Schnieb]], a halfling mage from Uthodurn, believes she has found evidence of a portal in the Savalirwood that leads to the Lower Planes. (She is only partly correct, of course, since there are many that in fact lead to locations on several planes.) She does not know it yet, but she is the first to learn of this development that is the start of a shift in the harmonic rifts. They are appearing consistently larger and lasting longer and in time this will lead to catastrophe.

Ludinus Da'leth of the [[Cerberus Assembly]]has been approached by the [[Ring of Three]] seeking information about this cataclysm.
