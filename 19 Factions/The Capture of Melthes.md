The Assembly, realizing the potential of such a unique individual, used a blend of persuasion and payment to convince his parents that [[Melthes]] required special care only they could provide. They promised his parents that he would be trained to harness his abilities for the greater good, while secretly intending to use him as a key asset in their exploration and exploitation of Feywild connections.

Usefulness to Assembly: [[Melthes]]'s abilities make him a valuable asset in navigating and manipulating the Feywild and its energies, which could be crucial for the Assembly's ambitions in expanding their magical prowess and understanding of different planes. His connection to the Feydark could also be used in political maneuvering, offering insights or leverage in dealings with fey entities or other planes-connected powers.
