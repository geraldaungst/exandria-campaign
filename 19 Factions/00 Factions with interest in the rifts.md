[[Obsidian Echoforge]]
- Trying to seal the rift with a device that will enhance the abilities of the Beacon ([[Aveqtaro Thaan]])
[[Malachite Cord]]
- Trying to stop the [[Obsidian Echoforge]] from building their device, which they think will cause further catastrophe
- Trying to find and cure the corruption in the Savalirwood and think it is spreading across Exandria via the rifts. (They are correct.)
- Is not yet aware of the [[Emissaries of the Sunfall|Emissaries]] or [[Vaud Qalix]].
[[Emissaries of the Sunfall]]
- Want to find a way to harness the power of the rifts for their own use. Originally directly opposed to the [[Obsidian Echoforge]], in recent years they have begun trying to work together.
- A splinter cell within the group, led by [[Valen Elderguard]] and financed by [[Vaud Qalix|Vaud Qalix]] is opposed to this partnership and is secretly working to undermine the work.
