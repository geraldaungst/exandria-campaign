Leaders of the city of Bysaes Tyl

Not long after The Calamity, the prominent elven society on Wildemount was the powerful nation of Molaesmyr, in what is now the Greying Wildlands. Through some "strange, not entirely understood cataclysm", the city fell in roughly 585 PD and the surrounding Veluthil Forest, now known as the Savalirwood, was corrupted. The elves scattered in two directions. Some of them went northward and joined Uthodurn, and the others fled westward and founded Bysaes Tyl.[11]

While the elves were able to build their city undiscovered for many years, the Dwendalian crown eventually became aware of their independent city-state and presented them with an ultimatum: accept Dwendalian rule, peacefully or by force. The Ring of Three convened and agreed not to fight but to submit and follow imperial laws and pay Imperial taxes, under the condition that they could maintain some level of cultural autonomy within their city.[4]
