# Goals
- Long-Term: Prevent the rifts from forming and prevent the [[Emissaries of the Sunfall|Emissaries]] from constructing a permanent door.
- Medium-Term: Researching the [[01 The Prophecy|Prophecy]]

The Ashari are extremely concerned about the potential for opening new rifts. They were the people who arose to seal the rifts formed at the last eclipse. They are adamantly opposed to the idea of a permanent door, but they are not allied with either of the other two groups (yet) since they do not have enough information to know if [[Aveqtaro Thaan]] is sincere or not.

Though the Ashari are rarely found in Wildemount, since the rifts they guard are not there, they have learned that the new rifts will most likely occur in Xhorhas, and so members of each of the Ashari tribes have formed an alliance, and a small group known as the Riftguard have been sent to Wildemount to research the [[01 The Prophecy|prophecy]] and find out how to prevent the rifts from forming.

# Riftguard
The Riftguard currently has four members, one from each of the Ashari tribes (left to right in the image above):
- [[Lorcan Vale]] of the Fire Ashari
- [[Melina Denos]] of the Water Ashari
- [[Durnn Keth]] of the Earth Ashari
- [[Sylphia Swiftcrest]] of the Air Ashari

These four Ashari represent a microcosm of the world's elements and reflect the Ashari's holistic approach to maintaining the balance between the planes. They each bring unique perspectives and abilities to the group, making them a formidable force against the chaotic energies threatening to upset the natural order.
