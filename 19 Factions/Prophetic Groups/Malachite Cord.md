# Organization
## Leadership Structure:

She leads the Cord with songs that are not only beautiful but are also said to carry fragments of [[Seraphina Amaris (Vicki)|Seraphina]]'s own wisdom and strength.
- **Inner Circle**: This small council includes [[Kael Dren'eth]] and [[Radelia Caphax]], among others, who are not just strategists and advisors but also custodians of the group's history and the legacy of the Aurora's Ascendant.
