(Xarzith Kitril Governing Council)
## 6 Council Members (all Ravenite Dragonborn)

Top row, left to right:
Zalthara Gikiaath: believes in a militant approach to secure the city's borders against potential threats. She is often in conflict with those who advocate for diplomatic solutions, arguing that strength and defense are paramount for the survival of Xarzith Kitril.

Hirrathak Vikeeshar: a staunch traditionalist, emphasizing the importance of preserving Ravenite culture and customs. He finds himself at odds with members who push for rapid modernization, arguing that the soul of the city lies in its heritage and ancestral practices.

Grexel Skadakian: an advocate for expanding trade relations, particularly focusing on technology and magical advancements. He often clashes with traditionalists, believing that Xarzith Kitril's future lies in becoming a hub of innovation and exchange.

Bottom row, left to right:
Tyrissa Weerasfok: a proponent of education and cultural exchange. She frequently debates with those who prefer isolation, believing that the cityâ€™s strength lies in understanding and learning from other cultures.

Korvarr Liatianok: an advocate for aggressive economic expansion, prioritizing the city's wealth and material prosperity. His focus on economic growth often puts him in opposition with those who argue for a more balanced approach to development.

Sarxina Viavazoth: argues for a focus on environmental conservation and maintaining a harmonious relationship with nature. She frequently finds herself in disagreement with members who prioritize urban expansion and industrial development over ecological concerns.

[[Vaud Qalix|Vaud Qalix]], Eye of the Scars, Protector of the Council, Head of the Wardens of the Ravine. Finds himself most often in alignment with the views of Zalthara and Hirrathak, but believes neither has the vision to make Draconia the world power he knows it can be. He does not voice that opinion openly, however.
