# Core Information

## Luxon Beacon Integration with Lorestone

### Theoretical Foundation

The integration between Luxon Beacons and the Lorestone of Eryndor is based on complementary dunamantic principles. While the Lorestone serves as a massive energy channeling device capable of manipulating planar boundaries, it creates dangerous temporal flux during operation. Luxon Beacons, as fragments of the Luxon that naturally manipulate time, entropy, and probability, provide the necessary temporal stabilization.

### Historical Design Intent

[[Illyndra Shadowveil]], the Drow artificer who created the Lorestone, was familiar with Luxon Beacons through her people's ancient knowledge. She intentionally designed the Lorestone to require dunamantic stabilization, understanding that channeling planar energies without temporal anchoring would create catastrophic feedback loops.

### Operational Mechanics

**Energy Flow Pattern:**

- **Lorestone:** Channels chaotic planar energy, creating temporal distortions as a byproduct
- **Luxon Beacon:** Generates stabilizing dunamantic field, anchoring local time flow
- **Combined Effect:** Controlled energy manipulation without temporal catastrophe

**Activation Sequence:**

1. Luxon Beacon activated first, establishing temporal stability field
2. Lorestone positioned within field radius (typically 30-100 feet depending on operation scale)
3. Dual-attuned operators channel energies simultaneously
4. Beacon maintains temporal coherence while Lorestone manipulates planar boundaries

### Proximity Effects

When a Luxon Beacon is within 100 feet of a Lorestone shard:

- Shard's detection range doubles (2,000 feet instead of 1,000)
- Phase-sight duration doubles (20 minutes instead of 10)
- Temporal "resonance" creates visible brightening of both artifacts
- Local magical effects become more stable and predictable

### Historical Precedents

**The Molaesmyr Disaster (585 PD):** Elven scholars attempted to use a Lorestone shard to stabilize the ruptured Fey Crossing without understanding the need for temporal stabilization. The resulting temporal chaos amplified the disaster from a localized rupture to city-wide destruction and regional corruption.

**Aeorian Research:** Ancient mages of Aeor discovered similar principles when experimenting with their "Relic" (likely a Luxon Beacon). Their research into "temporal transmutation" and "anchoring echoes" suggests they understood the stabilization requirements, though their work was lost in the city's destruction.

### Risks of Improper Integration

**Without Luxon Beacon:**

- Temporal flux creates expanding zone of magical instability
- Planar boundaries become permanently weakened
- Risk of creating multiple uncontrolled rifts
- Potential for reality-warping effects in large radius

**Improper Beacon Positioning:**

- Partial stabilization creates "temporal shear" effects
- Increased magical damage to operators
- Reduced effectiveness of rift manipulation
- Risk of beacon overload and subsequent failure

### Modern Implications

Most current factions are unaware of this dual-requirement:

- **Obsidian Echoforge:** Believes Lorestone alone is sufficient
- **Malachite Cord:** Fears Lorestone use but unaware proper stabilization exists
- **Emissaries of the Sunfall:** Seeks to exploit power without understanding safety requirements
- **Kryn Dynasty:** Possesses Beacons but unaware of integration possibilities

Only [[Aveqtaro Thaan]], through recovered memories of her past life as [[Cadariel Ordo]], possesses complete knowledge of the proper integration ritual.

# Relationship Details

## Nature of Connection

The Lorestone and Luxon Beacons represent complementary aspects of fundamental magical forces - chaos and order, energy and stability, potential and actuality.

## Impact/Implications

Understanding this integration is crucial for:

- Safe assembly and operation of the complete Lorestone
- Preventing future magical disasters like Molaesmyr
- Properly interpreting the prophecy's references to "beacon bright"
- Achieving lasting solutions to the rift crisis
