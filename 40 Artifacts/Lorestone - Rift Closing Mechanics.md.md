# Core Information

## Rift-Closing Ritual Details

**REQUIRES**: Assembled Lorestone AND active Luxon Beacon for temporal stabilization

The assembled Lorestone may be used as an arcane focus for a ritual for closing a nearby planar rift. The Luxon Beacon must be positioned to create a stabilization field around the ritual area. The details of the ritual are similar for all rifts, but the size of the rift determines the length and complexity of the ritual. See the rift table for specifics.

### Requirements:

- **Assembled Lorestone** must be placed within specific range of the rift (see table)
- **Active Luxon Beacon** positioned for temporal field coverage
- **Two participants** must simultaneously apply:
    - One chaotic effect (channeled through the Lorestone)
    - One ordered effect (channeled through the Beacon)
- Effects can be magical or physical (DM's discretion on what qualifies)
- Both make relevant skill/ability checks
- **Knowledge of proper ritual** (possessed by [[Aveqtaro Thaan]])

### Failed Attempts:

- **Without Luxon Beacon**: Automatic catastrophic failure - temporal rift opens, 8d10 force damage to all creatures within 100 feet, permanent planar instability
- **Below threshold**: No effect, but temporal strain accumulates
- **Less than half threshold**:
    - Rift tears further (+1 required success)
    - 2d10 damage to creatures within 15 feet
    - Damage type and saving throw based on connected plane
