## Lorestone Shard

_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_

A jagged fragment of obsidian, roughly 6 inches at its longest point, with ancient Elvish script etched in silvery mithral lines across its surface. The shard feels heavier than its size suggests and emits a faint, pulsing warmth when near planar disturbances.

**Planar Awareness.** While attuned to this shard, you can sense the direction and general nature of any planar rift within 1,000 feet of you. You instinctively know which plane the rift connects to (if any) and can sense the rift's approximate size and stability.

**Phase Sight.** When you are within 30 feet of a planar rift, you can use a bonus action to activate the shard's phase-sight ability for 10 minutes. While active, you can perceive both the Material Plane and the connected plane simultaneously, gaining the following benefits and drawbacks:

- You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
- Attack rolls against you have disadvantage.
- You have resistance to bludgeoning and slashing damage.
- You have disadvantage on your attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

**Prophecy Fragment.** The shard contains a portion of Eryndor's prophecy written in an ancient dialect of Elvish. Reading it requires fluency in Elvish and a successful DC 20 Intelligence (History) check (made with disadvantage if you lack proficiency in History). The specific verses depend on which shard this is.

**Temporal Resonance.** The shard has a subtle connection to dunamantic magic. When a Luxon Beacon is within 100 feet, the shard's surface brightens noticeably, and both the planar awareness range and phase sight duration are doubled.

## Lorestone of Eryndor (Assembled)

_Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)_

A perfectly circular obsidian disc, 2 feet in diameter, inscribed with the complete Prophecy of Eryndor in flowing Elvish script inlaid with mithral and star metal. When whole, the disc radiates an aura of ancient power and barely contained energy that makes the air shimmer around it.

**Random Properties.** The Lorestone has the following random properties:

- 1 minor beneficial property
- 1 major beneficial property
- 1 minor detrimental property

**Enhanced Planar Awareness.** While attuned to the complete Lorestone, you can sense the direction and nature of any planar rift within 3,000 feet of you. You instinctively know which plane each rift connects to, its size, stability, and approximate age.

**Planar Phase Shift.** When you are within 90 feet of a planar rift, you can use a bonus action to activate phase shifting for up to 1 hour. While phase-shifted, you gain all the benefits and drawbacks of the shard's Phase Sight ability, but the duration is extended and you can end the effect early as a bonus action. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

**Rift Seal Focus.** The Lorestone can serve as an arcane focus for a powerful ritual to permanently close planar rifts. This ritual requires:

- **Temporal Stabilization:** An active Luxon Beacon positioned to create a stabilization field around the ritual area
- **Dual Channeling:** Two attuned spellcasters working in unison - one channeling chaotic energy through the Lorestone, one channeling ordered energy through the Beacon
- **Ritual Knowledge:** Complete understanding of the stabilization ritual (known only to certain individuals)
- **Time and Components:** The ritual's complexity depends on the rift's size (see Rift Size Table)

**Prophecy Complete.** The assembled Lorestone contains Eryndor's complete prophecy. Reading it requires fluency in Elvish and a successful DC 20 Intelligence (History) check (made with disadvantage if you lack proficiency in History). The complete text reveals crucial information about the nature of the rifts and the proper methods for addressing them.

**Spells.** While attuned to the Lorestone, you can cast the following spells from it:

- _Detect Magic_ (at will)
- _Identify_ (3/day)
- _Plane Shift_ (1/day, but only to the last plane you detected with Planar Awareness)
- _Banishment_ (1/day)

The Lorestone regains all expended spell uses at dawn.

**Destroying the Lorestone.** The assembled Lorestone can only be destroyed by using it to seal a rift of Gargantuan size or larger without proper temporal stabilization. This causes a catastrophic temporal explosion that destroys the Lorestone, creates a permanent planar instability, and deals 20d10 force damage to all creatures within 1 mile (no save). The explosion also tears open multiple random rifts in a 10-mile radius.

**CRITICAL WARNING:** Attempting to use the Lorestone for rift sealing without an active Luxon Beacon providing temporal stabilization will trigger the destruction sequence described above.

## Design Notes

- **Scaling Power:** Individual shards are powerful but limited; the complete artifact is world-changing
- **Risk vs. Reward:** The complete Lorestone is incredibly powerful but extremely dangerous if misused
- **Plot Integration:** Both forms tie directly into the campaign's central mysteries and faction conflicts
- **Mechanical Balance:** The requirement for both Lorestone and Luxon Beacon prevents any single faction from achieving their goals alone
