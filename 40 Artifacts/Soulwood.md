[[The Origin of Soulwood - A Folktale]]

When a magic user dies, their innate magical essence typically disperses into the Weave. However, if their death occurs near a tree's root system, something extraordinary can happen. The tree's natural processes of absorbing nutrients from the soil intersect with this release of magical energy, and over time, the tree undergoes a profound transformation into soulwood. This process is more likely when the death involves significant magical trauma (such as a battle) or peaceful acceptance (such as a mage choosing their final resting place), but can occur with any magic user's death.

The transformation takes several years:
- First Year: The tree's roots develop an unusual crystalline structure visible only if unearthed, forming geometric patterns that mirror common arcane symbols
- Years 2-5: The transformation spreads upward through the trunk, altering the cellular structure to become magically insulative
- Years 5-10: The entire tree completes its conversion to soulwood

Identifying a soulwood tree:

Survival check:
- DC 13: Notices areas within the forest where animal tracks and trails seem to diverge unexpectedly or avoid certain locations

Nature check:
- DC 14: Spots sections that are unusually clear of undergrowth and debris except for fallen branches and limbs from the tree.
- DC 18: Spots a tree that is remarkably healthy, large, or shows fewer signs of aging than the surrounding trees.

Perception check:
- DC 15: Spots a tree with a subtle iridescent quality when wet, similar to oil on water
- Small animals might pause and seem to acknowledge the tree when passing (DC 18 Perception or DC 15 Nature)

Detect Magic
- Detect Magic reveals the tree has a faint aura of both necromantic and abjuration magic.

Additional properties:
- Fallen branches retain their properties indefinitely, making them ideal for harvesting
- Cutting into a living soulwood tree produces a faint keening sound at the edge of hearing
- The wood is unusually dense and has a darker color than the same species of normal tree
- Soulwood trees are exceptionally resistant to disease and parasites
- They never produce fruit or seeds, even if the original species typically would

This explanation would allow for soulwood trees to:
- Appear anywhere in the world where magic users have died near trees
- Be more common near old battlefields, abandoned mage towers, or traditional meditation spots
- Create interesting adventure hooks (following historical records of magical battles or seeking out known burial sites of powerful spellcasters)
- Generate compelling narrative moments (a party finding a soulwood tree might lead to discovering the story of who died there)

Would you like me to also provide some specific examples of locations in Exandria where these trees might be found based on known historical events?
