How Made: Shadowdance Sake is an exquisite and rare beverage, crafted from a special variety of black rice known only to grow in the shadowy, mist-covered lands surrounding the village. This rice is cherished for its deep, rich color and unique flavor profile, which is enhanced by the enigmatic energies of the land. The brewing process is painstakingly undertaken in subterranean cellars, where the constant, cool darkness mirrors the perpetual twilight of the shadowy groves where the rice originates. During the fermentation process, the sake is infused with a distilled essence of Shadowthorn berries, imbuing the drink with its magical properties and complex flavor.

Taste: Shadowdance Sake offers a profound depth of flavor; the initial sip is crisp and clean, with a mineral bite. Soon thereafter as the sake fills your nose, your palate senses the earthy undertones of the black rice, which then unfolds into a rich tapestry of dark berry notes. The finish is surprisingly smooth, leaving a lingering taste that evokes the mysterious tranquility of a moonless night.

Single Shot Effect: Your shadow dances independently for a few minutes, mimicking your movements with a slight delay.

Two Shot Effect: You temporarily lose control of your shadow, and it starts moving unpredictably, which can be disconcerting to you and those around you.
