Long ago, during the **Age of Arcanum**, when magic surged wildly across Exandria, a group of druids devoted to the **Wildmother** sought to protect the natural world from the unchecked forces of arcane chaos. In their quest, they encountered a vast, uncontrolled rift threatening to warp the surrounding forests. Unable to close the rift, the druids made a desperate choice: they would sacrifice themselves, merging their **souls** with the land to contain the magic.

From the sites of their sacrifice, **trees began to grow**, their roots infused with the essence of the fallen druids.
