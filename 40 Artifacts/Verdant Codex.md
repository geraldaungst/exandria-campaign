The Verdant Codex was originally [[Seraphina Amaris (Vicki)|Seraphina's]] childhood nature journal. At some point in the group's past, the [[Malachite Cord]] found it, preserved it, and over time has come to believe it to be a sacred text worth study and meditation.

### Preserved Original:

- **Magical Protection**: Given their deep respect for the Aurora's Ascendant and their access to skilled magic users, the original nature journal would almost certainly have been magically preserved. Enchantments to prevent aging, decay, and damage from the elements would be essential to keeping the journal intact. This preservation might have been one of the group's early priorities upon acquiring the artifact.
- **Sacred Storage**: The original journal would be kept in a specially consecrated area within their hidden base, possibly in a shrine or vault designed to protect and honor [[Seraphina Amaris (Vicki)|Seraphina]]'s relic. Only the highest-ranking members or those undergoing significant rites or missions might be granted the chance to view or study it directly.

### Copies and Transcriptions:

- **Widespread Use**: Recognizing the importance of the wisdom within the pages and the risk of losing it, the [[Malachite Cord]] would likely have made detailed copies and transcriptions of the journal. These copies allow members to study and utilize [[Seraphina Amaris (Vicki)|Seraphina]]'s observations without risking the original artifact.
- **Evolving Interpretations**: Over the centuries, as the journal has been copied, members might have added annotations, interpretations, and cross-references to other works or their own findings. These evolving documents serve not only as a preservation of [[Seraphina Amaris (Vicki)|Seraphina]]'s insights but also as a living record of the Cord's ongoing work and understanding of the forest's magic and the corruption they combat.
