# Core Information

A 2-foot diameter obsidian disc engraved with the [[01 The Prophecy|Prophecy]] of [[Eryndor]] in an ancient dialect of Elvish. To read the prophecy requires both:

- DC 20 Intelligence (History) check (disadvantage if not proficient)
- Fluency in Elvish

Individual shards of the Lorestone register as magic items. When the holder of a Shard is within 1000 feet of a planar rift, the holder can sense the direction of the rift as well as the nature of the plane to which the rift is connected. When within 30 feet of a planar rift, the holder becomes partially phase-shifted and can perceive both planes at once.

*For complete mechanical details, see [[Lorestone - Magic Item Blocks]]*
