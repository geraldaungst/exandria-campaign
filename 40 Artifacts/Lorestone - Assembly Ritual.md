# Core Information

## Assembly Requirements

**CRITICAL WARNING**: Attempting to assemble or use the Lorestone without a Luxon Beacon for temporal stabilization will result in catastrophic temporal flux, potentially creating another Molaesmyr-level disaster.

With some investigation, the players will ascertain that there will be **FIVE** parts to the process. The first four can be accomplished in any order, but the fifth must be completed with all others present:

1. **Cleansing the Shards**:
    
    - The Calamity and the following centuries have imbued the shards with a chaotic "noise" that must be removed.
    - Multiple options exist to do so via the four elemental planes.
2. **Harmonizing the Shards**:
    
    - Before they can be reassembled, the various pieces must be synchronized with each other so they resonate in harmony.
3. **Weaving the Shards**:
    
    - Before the shards can be reassembled into one whole, they must be tied together with threads of fate so they can never be sundered again.
4. **Temporal Stabilization Preparation**:
    
    - A Luxon Beacon must be prepared and positioned for the assembly ritual
    - Requires knowledge of the proper stabilization ritual (known to [[Aveqtaro Thaan]])
5. **Assembling the Stone**:
    
    - The energy of a planar rift must be channeled into the stone to bind its parts together and make it whole once more.
    - **MUST** be performed with Luxon Beacon active and properly positioned
    - Requires simultaneous operation by someone attuned to the Beacon and someone channeling the rift energy
