# **Description**:  
The Riftcage is a modest, palm-sized device made from **soulwood**, a dense and magically insulating material harvested from solitary soulwood trees. The wood is difficult to work with so crafting a riftcage is time consuming and requires expert woodworkers and druidic magic. The Riftcage is simple in appearance, an egglike shape of dark wood with runes carved around the outside.

# **Function**:  
The Riftcage is designed to **contain energy siphoned from a rift**, preventing it from leaking into the Material Plane. While the energy is held within, the device passively dissipates the power into the earth through the natural materials used in its construction, slowly returning it to the environment over time. The energy inside **cannot be harnessed** for spells or other uses, as the Riftcage is strictly a containment tool. Over time, the stored energy naturally fades, but while it is contained, the device remains **inherently unstable**. If jostled too much, exposed to anti-magic, or kept filled for too long, it may crack, releasing dangerous planar energy.
# **Material and Creation**:
- [[Soulwood]]
- **Silverleaf Vine**: A magically resonant vine that grows in the heart of the Verdant Expanse, known for its ability to ground arcane forces.
  
The Riftcage is created using the **Mending** spell to shape the soulwood, combined with **Plant Growth** to reinforce the silverleaf bands and ensure they can channel energy effectively. The **Magic Circle** spell is used during the final stages of its construction to bind the device to the material plane and prepare it to hold rift energy.
# **Usage**:  
To use a Riftcage, the bearer must be within range of the rift (see the [[Rift Size Table]] for ranges). The bearer must first cast *Absorb Elements* to link the riftcage to the rift, then maintain concentration on the Riftcage for the duration of energy absorbtion. Each riftcage being used must be used by a different bearer. Every two rounds, a rift linked to a sufficient riftcages (see table) will reduce in size by one level. A Small rift will not be closed after two rounds, but it will be reduced to a size that makes it impossible for anything to pass through. Over time, however, rifts may regain energy through a variety of means and can grow again.

When in use, the Riftcage does not glow or hum, but it radiates a faint warmth, and  it feels especially heavy. The device can contain the rift energy for 7 days. Over the course of that time, the rift energy slowly dissipates. After all the energy is gone, the riftcage can be reused. Although stable under normal conditions, any major disruption can cause the Riftcage to fail catastrophically, discharging the rift energy in an uncontrolled burst.

## Riftcage Mechanics

**Armor Class** 15  
**Hit Points** 50  
**Damage Threshold**: 10 

---

**Damage Immunities**: Cold, Necrotic, Poison, Psychic, Lightning.
**Damage Resistances**: Acid, Fire, Force, Radiant, Thunder, Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing

Weakened: When the riftcage is reduced to 10 hit points, it will begin to tremble and vibrate, slowly at first, then increasing in magnitude as it nears failure.

**Rupture**: When the Riftcage is reduced to 0 hit points, it ruptures, releasing the stored rift energy. All creatures within 30 feet must make a **DC 15 Dexterity saving throw**, taking **6d6 force damage** on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Additionally, the DM may choose to have a temporary rift open for 1d4 rounds, causing further potential hazards or chaotic effects based on the plane the rift was connected to.

If someone attempts to store rift energy in a discharged (used) Riftcage, it will appear to work at first, but it will silently lose 1 hp per round until it ruptures as described above.

*Dispel Magic* has no effect on an intact Riftcage. If it is cast on a **weakekend** riftcage (see above), the dispel magic may pass through tiny fissures in the wood, creating a similar resonance effect to the Anti-Magic field (see below). Each round, the Riftcage makes a roll against the spellcaster's DC. If it fails, it takes 5 points of Force damage. If it succeeds, the resonance subsides for a round.

Healing spells have no effect on the object.

*Mending* will repair 1d4 hp of damage with each casting, but the caster must make a DC 10 saving throw using their spellcasting ability. A failure means the caster takes 1d4 hp of Force damage when the spell rebounds off of the insulating soulwood. 

If an *Anti-Magic Field* is cast on the Riftcage, the spell and the soulwood may initiate a resonance feedback loop. The Riftcage will begin to vibrate and it will take 10hp of Force damage every round until the Riftcage ruptures or the spell ends.

**Description**: The Riftcage is a small, palm-sized construct made of soulwood. It is designed to contain and slowly dissipate planar energy. Though resilient, it is not impervious to damage and can rupture if exposed to overwhelming force or magic.
