# Core Information

_Research suggests that during the Molaesmyr catastrophe in 585 PD, elven scholars attempted to use a Lorestone shard to stabilize the ruptured Fey Crossing. Without knowledge of the proper stabilization requirements, their attempt created massive temporal chaos that amplified the disaster, turning a localized magical rupture into the widespread corruption that consumed the entire city and created the cursed Savalirwood._
