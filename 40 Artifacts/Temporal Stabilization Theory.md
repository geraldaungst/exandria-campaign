# Core Information

## Temporal Stabilization Theory

### Fundamental Principles

Temporal stabilization theory describes the magical principles governing how massive energy manipulations affect the flow of time and local reality. When arcane forces channel planar energies at the scale required for rift manipulation, they inevitably create temporal flux as a byproduct - distortions in the normal flow of time that can cascade into reality-warping disasters.

### The Nature of Temporal Flux

**Primary Cause:** Large-scale energy channeling creates "temporal pressure" - areas where time flows at different rates or in conflicting directions. This occurs because:

- Planar energies exist partially outside normal temporal flow
- Channeling them "drags" portions of other planes' temporal properties into the Material Plane
- Local time becomes unstable as it tries to reconcile conflicting temporal states

**Manifestation Effects:**

- Time dilation or acceleration in unpredictable patterns
- Temporal "echoes" where past or future events bleed into the present
- Reality distortions as causality becomes confused
- Cascade failures where small temporal anomalies amplify into large-scale disasters

### Dunamantic Stabilization Mechanisms

Dunamantic magic, particularly as channeled through Luxon Beacons, provides temporal stabilization through several mechanisms:

**Temporal Anchoring:**

- Dunamis naturally "anchors" local timeflow to a stable reference point
- Prevents temporal drift or acceleration during energy manipulation
- Creates a "buffer zone" where time remains coherent despite magical disturbances

**Probability Stabilization:**

- Dunamantic fields reduce random temporal fluctuations
- "Lock in" successful outcomes while preventing catastrophic variables
- Provide operators with "fragments of possibility" to course-correct dangerous developments

**Causal Enforcement:**

- Maintain logical cause-and-effect relationships during magical operations
- Prevent temporal paradoxes from destabilizing local reality
- Ensure that energy channeling follows predictable magical laws

### Historical Applications and Failures

**Age of Arcanum Research:** Ancient mages understood these principles intuitively, though they lacked modern terminology. Aeoran researchers called it "temporal anchoring" and developed early stabilization techniques. Their T-Dock project demonstrated both the potential and dangers of temporal manipulation.

**The Molaesmyr Catastrophe (585 PD):** The elven attempt to stabilize the Fey Crossing rupture without temporal stabilization created a textbook example of temporal cascade failure:

1. **Initial Instability:** Lorestone shard channeled massive planar energy without anchoring
2. **Temporal Pressure Buildup:** Local time began flowing at conflicting rates
3. **Cascade Failure:** Temporal distortions amplified the original magical rupture
4. **Reality Breakdown:** Conflicting timeflows created permanent magical corruption
5. **Regional Spread:** Unstabilized temporal energy continued expanding outward for centuries

**Kryn Dynasty Discoveries:** Through centuries of Luxon Beacon study, Kryn researchers developed practical dunamancy without fully understanding the theoretical framework. Their success in consecution and graviturgy/chronurgy magic demonstrates working knowledge of temporal stabilization, though they've never applied it to large-scale planar manipulation.

### Modern Theoretical Framework

**The Stabilization Requirement:** Any magical operation involving energies above approximately 7th-level spell equivalency requires some form of temporal stabilization to prevent cascade failures. The larger the scale, the more robust the stabilization must be.

**Artifact-Scale Operations:**

- **Lorestone Assembly:** Requires active Luxon Beacon within 100 feet
- **Rift Sealing:** Needs both temporal anchoring and probability stabilization
- **Planar Gateway Creation:** Would demand multiple Beacons and extensive preparation

**The Risk Gradient:**

- **Minor Operations:** Temporal drift, localized time distortion (recoverable)
- **Moderate Failures:** Temporal "wounds" that heal over years or decades
- **Major Catastrophes:** Permanent reality damage, regional corruption (Molaesmyr-scale)
- **Critical Failures:** Planar boundary collapse, timeline fragmentation (theoretical)

### Practical Applications

**Detection Methods:**

- Dunamantic practitioners can sense temporal pressure buildup
- Lorestone shards resonate more strongly when temporal flux is present
- Chronurgy wizards experience physical discomfort in unstabilized magical fields

**Stabilization Techniques:**

- **Passive Stabilization:** Luxon Beacon presence creates automatic temporal anchoring field
- **Active Stabilization:** Trained dunamancer channels stabilizing energy during operations
- **Ritual Stabilization:** Complex ceremonies can prepare areas for major magical workings

**Emergency Protocols:** If temporal flux begins during an operation:

1. Immediately cease energy channeling
2. Activate all available dunamantic stabilization
3. Evacuate non-essential personnel from affected area
4. Monitor for cascade development over following days/weeks

### Knowledge Distribution

**Who Understands This Theory:**

- **Comprehensive:** [[Aveqtaro Thaan]] (through recovered memories)
- **Partial:** Advanced Kryn dunamancers, some Cerberus Assembly researchers
- **Practical but not theoretical:** Experienced chronurgy/graviturgy practitioners
- **Historical precedent only:** Molaesmyr survivors, certain Cobalt Soul scholars

**Faction Blind Spots:**

- **Obsidian Echoforge:** Focused on energy channeling, ignores temporal effects
- **Malachite Cord:** Fears the symptoms but doesn't understand the underlying cause
- **Emissaries of the Sunfall:** Seeks power without comprehending safety requirements
- **Vaud Qalix:** Ceratos deliberately withholds this knowledge to encourage failure

### Research Implications

Understanding temporal stabilization theory is crucial for:

- Safe assembly and operation of the Lorestone
- Preventing future magical disasters
- Advancing dunamantic magical theory
- Interpreting pre-Calamity magical research
- Developing new applications for Luxon Beacon technology

The theory also suggests that many "mysterious" magical disasters throughout history may have been caused by temporal cascade failures, making this knowledge valuable for both practical applications and historical research.
