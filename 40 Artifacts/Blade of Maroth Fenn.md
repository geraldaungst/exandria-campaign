## Description

![[blade-of-maroth-fenn.jpeg|right|300]]
This kukri-style blade is about 15 inches from pommel to tip. The cutting edge is on the inner curve, and the spine has a series of jagged serrations. The blade is nearly black with a silver spiral Damascus pattern throughout. The grip is yellowed bone, very smooth, and well-worn. The guard and pommel are silver and wood. It appears as though it was once covered with intricate and delicate carvings, but most of those have worn down from age, which is unexpected for a magic item.

## History
Legend says this blade was forged through a collaboration between the elves of Syngorn and the dwarves of Kraghammer for Maroth Fenn, cleric of Avandra, for use in the conflict against Errevon the Rimelord during the Icelost Years. Some sources believe Maroth Fenn and the Blade were one reason the alliance was able to turn the tide and allow the Ashari to close the rift. Soon after the end of the conflict, the blade was lost.

### Properties
The blade is magic. You have a +1 bonus to Attack and Damage rolls made with this weapon. If the weapon is thrown, it is recalled to its scabbard at the start of the wielder’s next turn. When you take the Attack action and attack with an unarmed strike or a melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, the wielder can use the Blade of Maroth Fenn to make a single melee or thrown weapon attack as a bonus action. This bonus attack will add your ability modifier to damage.

The blade also has 2 charges.
- As a bonus action, the wielder can use one charge to cast Cure Wounds.
- When the blade is used in an attack action that hits the target, the wielder may use a bonus action to infuse the blade with a small portion of their own life force; in so doing, the wielder takes radiant damage equal to the damage inflicted in the attack, and the blade regains one charge. On a critical hit, the blade regains 2 charges.
- Each day at sundown, if the blade is not fully charged, it regains d4-2 charges (if the result is negative or zero, the blade regains none).

When the Blade is used by a non-spellcaster, it has a spellcasting modifier of +4 and a spell DC of 14.

Proficiency with a dagger allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.

## Secrets
> [!secret]- DM Only
> ### Progression
>This is a Vestige of Divergence. The magic properties of this blade grow over time. If the same person remains attuned to it and keeps the blade in its matching scabbard, additional properties will be awakened.
>
> An Identify spell will only reveal the current magic properties and none of what may develop in the future. However, if the caster succeeds on a DC 20 arcana check while identifying, they will know that there is something else unique about the blade that is magically hidden from them and cannot be revealed by the spell.
>
>Progression depends on the skills of the wielder. As long as the character stays attuned to the Blade of Maroth Fenn and keeps it sheathed in its matching scabbard when not being used, the blade will gain the following additional properties each time the character’s proficiency bonus increases. At the DM’s discretion, additional properties may also be gained due to highly significant events in the character’s life.
>If the blade remains attuned but is somehow separated from its scabbard, the blade will lose one level of progression every five days they are apart until it reverts to its basic properties described above. Reuniting the blade with its scabbard will maintain the dagger at whatever level of progression it currently holds. Lost levels can only be regained through another increase in proficiency or significant life events (at DM’s discretion).
>
>Losing attunement will revert it immediately to an ordinary dagger for the player. If the player re-attunes after this, progression starts over, and any lost levels must be regained through additional increases in proficiency. Any character attuned to the blade when it is Awakened or higher will be aware of this risk.
