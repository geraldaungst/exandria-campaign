**Shard of Willow's Legacy**
_Wondrous item (pendant), legendary (requires attunement by a descendant of the Willowwhisper lineage)_

_Appearance:_ This shard is a fragment of the original obsidian disc, now fashioned into a pendant. Roughly the size of a palm, its deep black surface has a mirror-like sheen, catching light in peculiar, arcane patterns. Set in an ornate silver setting, the shard is suspended on a chain of intertwining silver and green, representing the melding of nature and magic.

_Properties:_

- **Ancestral Recall:** While attuned and wearing the pendant, the bearer can invoke the wisdom of the Willowwhisper lineage. Once per day, they can gain advantage on an Arcana, History, or Nature check.
    
- **Guidance of the Fragments:** The pendant resonates when another fragment of the obsidian disc is within 1 mile, emitting a soft, pulsating glow and humming a faint tune that only the wearer can hear.
    
- **Protector’s Ward:** When the wearer of the pendant is attacked, they can use their reaction to invoke the shard’s protective power, granting them resistance to one type of damage (chosen at the moment of invocation) for 1 round. This ability recharges after a long rest.
    
- **Echoes of Prophecy:** When in the presence of a fragment or the complete obsidian disc, the bearer can concentrate on the pendant, allowing them to hear faint whispers, snippets of the [[01 The Prophecy|prophecy]]. This can provide cryptic guidance or hints about future events, at the DM's discretion.
    
- **Legacy's Bond:** If the wearer of the pendant is ever reduced to 0 hit points and is not killed outright, they can choose to shatter the shard, instantly stabilizing themselves and gaining half their maximum hit points. This ability destroys the pendant and can only be used once.
    

_Sentience:_ The Shard of Willow's Legacy is semi-sentient, holding memories of past Willowwhisper leaders. It has a neutral alignment and possesses emotions but does not communicate verbally. Instead, it conveys feelings and urges to the attuned wearer, often guiding or warning them based on the collective wisdom of the Willowwhisper lineage.

_Attunement:_ To attune to the Shard of Willow's Legacy, one must be of the Willowwhisper bloodline. The process involves a ritual that connects the wearer's spirit to the shard, invoking memories and legacy of the lineage.
