# Description
A 2-foot diameter obsidian disc engraved with the [[01 The Prophecy|Prophecy]] of [[Eryndor]] in an ancient dialect of Elvish. To read the prophecy requires both:
- DC 20 Intelligence (History) check (disadvantage if not proficient)
- Fluency in Elvish

# History
The Lorestone was broken during the Calamity, its pieces initially scattering across the Shattered Teeth. Over time, some pieces have been recovered by the [[Obsidian Echoforge]], while others have migrated to other parts of Exandria through various means. Currently:
## Known Locations:
- Shards 1-4: [[Lyren Willowwhisper]] of the [[Obsidian Echoforge]]
- Shard 5: [[Archivist Ovedo]] at Rexxentrum Archive of the [[Cobalt Soul]]
	- Ovedo is researching the shard and its powers.
	- Ovedo knows of the existence of the Obsidian Echoforge, but has chosen not to let the group know that the Cobalt Soul has located this shard.
- Shard 6: Recently discovered in Marquet, sought by [[Celdric Ambril]]. Currently in possession of [[Dreyara Drimvar]].
- Shard 7: Brought back aboard the [[Consecution's Hope]] to Xhorhas. The map is in possession of [[Keldar Stonefoot]]. The shard was later acquired by an adult Black Dragon named [[Shoagragoth, The Acid Crown]], Tyrant of the Ebonglass. (Around level 12-14)
- Shard 8: TBD (Around level 15-17)

# Powers/Effects

*Wondrous item, artifact, requires attunement (for the fully assembled Lorestone)*

This 2-foot diameter obsidian disc is engraved with the [[01 The Prophecy|Prophecy]] of [[Eryndor]] in an ancient dialect of Elvish. A DC 20 Intelligence(History) check *and* fluency in Elvish are required to read it; a reader not proficient in History makes the check at disadvantage due to the obscurity of the dialect.

Individual shards of the Lorestone register as magic items. When the holder of a Shard is within 1000 feet of a planar rift, the holder can sense the direction of the rift as well as the nature of the plane to which the rift is connected. When within 30 feet of a planar rift, the holder becomes partially phase-shifted and can perceive both planes at once. While phased, 
- the holder has advantage on all Dexterity(Stealth) checks;
- any attempts to attack or grapple the holder are made at disadvantage;
- the holder has resistance to bludgeoning and slashing damage;
- the holder has *disadvantage* on attack rolls and Wisdom(Perception) checks.

When the Lorestone is fully assembled and the holder is attuned to the object, the range of the above features is tripled (3000 feet for sensing direction and 90 feet for phase shifting).
## Individual Shard Powers
- Registers as a magic item
- Within 1,000 feet of planar rifts:
	- Sense direction and nature of connected plane
- Within 30 feet of planar rifts:
	- Phase-shift ability to perceive both planes
	- Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth)
	- Attacks against bearer have disadvantage
	- Resistance to bludgeoning and slashing damage
	- Disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception)

## Assembled Lorestone Powers
- All shard abilities enhanced:
  - Sensing range extended to 3,000 feet
  - Phase-shift range extended to 90 feet
- Functions as focus for rift-closing rituals

# Secrets
## Missing Prophecy Lines
**Shard 6:** ^shard6
- *"Wildmother's care and Arch Heart's grace could not corruption quell."*
- *"Secrets loom, in twilight's reach, as cosmic paths are clouded."*

**Shard 7:** ^shard7
- *"In the abyss, a beacon bright, its fate a mysterious stone,"*
- *"Order and chaos, in union move, as the rifts' song grows strong,"*

**Shard 8:** ^shard8
- *"On destiny's edge, a task unfolds, to reforge wisdom's Key,"*
- *"Its whispers hold a fate untold, in time's final decree."*

## Assembling the Lorestone
Reassembling the Lorestone of Eryndor is a complex and delicate process. Given that no similar artifact has ever been shattered and reassembled, there is no documented way to accomplish this. With some investigation, the players will ascertain that there will be four parts to the process. The first three can be accomplished in any order:
1. **Cleansing the Shards**:
	- The Calamity and the following centuries have imbued the shards with a chaotic "noise" that must be removed.
	- Multiple options exist to do so via the four elemental planes.
1. **Harmonizing the Shards**:
	- Before they can be reassembled, the various pieces must be synchronized with each other so they resonate in harmony.
2. **Weaving the Shards**:
	- Before the shards can be reassembled into one whole, they must be tied together with threads of fate so they can never be sundered again.
3. **Assembling the Stone**:
	- The energy of a planar rift must be channelled into the stone to bind its parts together and make it whole once more.

## Rift-Closing Ritual Details
The assembled Lorestone may also be used as an arcane focus for a ritual for closing a nearby planar rift. The details of the ritual are similar for all rifts, but the size of the rift determines the length and complexity of the ritual. See the rift table for specifics.

### Requirements:
- Lorestone must be placed within specific range of the rift (see table)
- Two participants must simultaneously apply:
  - One chaotic effect
  - One ordered effect
- Effects can be magical or physical (DM's discretion on what qualifies)
- Both make relevant skill/ability checks

### [[Rift Size Table]]
![[Rift Size Table]]

### Failed Attempts:
- Below threshold: No effect
- Less than half threshold:
  - Rift tears further (+1 required success)
  - 2d10 damage to creatures within 15 feet
  - Damage type and saving throw based on connected plane

## Notes
- [[Archivist Ovedo]] knows of the [[Obsidian Echoforge]] but hasn't revealed possession of Shard 5
- [[Celdric Ambril]] doesn't know Shard 6's significance or true owner
