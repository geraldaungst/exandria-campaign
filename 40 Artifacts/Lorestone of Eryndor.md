# Faction Understanding

## Current Interpretations (All Incomplete):

**[[Obsidian Echoforge]]**: Believes the Lorestone itself is the "beacon" mentioned in the prophecy. Correct that it can close rifts, incorrect about it being sufficient alone. Unaware of stabilization requirements.

**[[Malachite Cord]]**: Believes using the Lorestone will cause rifts to tear wider. Partially correct - unstabilized use WILL cause catastrophic failure. Unaware that proper stabilization makes it safe and effective.

**[[Emissaries of the Sunfall]]**: Believes the Lorestone can create permanent controlled gateways. Fundamentally wrong about its purpose, but their desire to control rather than close rifts makes them especially dangerous.

**[[Vaud Qalix]]**: Believes he can use it to create stable energy siphons for Draconia. Completely wrong about its capabilities and unaware of Ceratos's manipulation. His patron deliberately withholds knowledge of stabilization requirements.

# Notes

- [[Archivist Ovedo]] knows of the [[Obsidian Echoforge]] but hasn't revealed possession of Shard 5
- [[Celdric Ambril]] doesn't know Shard 6's significance or true owner
- **The prophecy's "beacon bright" refers to the Luxon Beacon, not the Lorestone**
- **Only [[Aveqtaro Thaan]] possesses complete knowledge of the dual-artifact requirement**
