# Core Information

[[Eryndor]], aware of the weight and significance of their visions, knew the prophecy needed to be preserved in a manner that would withstand the ravages of time. They sought out a famed Drow artificer named [[Illyndra Shadowveil]], who was known for her mastery in crafting artifacts imbued with protective magic.

Together, they devised a plan. Eryndor would dictate the prophecy, and Illyndra would inscribe it onto a large, circular obsidian disc (which would come to be known as the [[Lorestone of Eryndor]]) using an alloy of mithral and star metal, materials known for their resilience and connection to ancient magic.

**Crucially**, Illyndra designed the Lorestone to work in conjunction with a Luxon Beacon. As a Drow artificer familiar with dunamantic principles, she understood that channeling the massive energies needed to manipulate planar rifts would create dangerous temporal flux. The Lorestone was intentionally created as an energy channeling device that required temporal stabilization from a Luxon Beacon to operate safely.

Once inscribed, Illyndra cast spells of preservation and temporal anchoring, ensuring the disc would remain stable and that its eventual use would be guided by those who understood the dual-artifact requirement. The disc was then placed in the heart of the Nightshade Caverns, a labyrinthine network of tunnels deep beneath Exandria's surface. Hidden behind a waterfall and guarded by natural traps and elemental wards, the caverns were known only to a few and were spoken of in hushed tones, adding a layer of myth to its actual significance.

During the tumultuous events of the Calamity, the protective magic surrounding the Nightshade Caverns held firm against the chaos that raged outside. However, a single, powerful surge of energy managed to penetrate the caverns, reaching the obsidian disc and shattering it into fragments. Each piece, infused with a part of the prophecy and carrying its own protective enchantment, was flung far and wide, eventually coming to rest upon the various islands of the Shattered Teeth.

Centuries later, a Firbolg scholar named [[Lys Willowwhisper]], driven by dreams of a shimmering disc and echoing chants of a prophecy, began an expedition to uncover lost artifacts of the pre-Calamity era. After years of piecing together fragmented tales and ancient maps, Lys, accompanied by a team of adventurers, managed to uncover the obscured entrance to what once was the Nightshade Caverns. They finally found the first fragment of the disc. Hungry for the rest of the prophecy and understanding its gravity, Lys began a relentless quest to find the other pieces.

Over the next four hundred years, The Seekers of Eryndor's Echo (later known as the [[Obsidian Echoforge]]) grew in number and dedication. Lys' descendants, along with followers inspired by the tale, dedicated their lives to the search. They braved stormy seas, battled lurking sea creatures, and deciphered ancient clues. With each passing generation, they pieced together more of the prophecy.
