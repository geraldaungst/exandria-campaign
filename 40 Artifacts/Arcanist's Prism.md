A rare crystal rumored to be capable of dispersing focused magical energy, reducing the risk of catastrophic feedback during planar manipulation. The Prism is crucial for the dispersal device the Wardens are constructing; without it, the device could malfunction or amplify the rifts instead of closing them.

## Legend

The object known now as the Arcanist's Prism was originally crafted by a coalition of mages from the Age of Arcanum, a time when the mastery over magic was at its zenith. These mages were focused on the creation of a tool that could be used to safely study and harness the power of the ley lines, the invisible channels of raw magical energy that crisscross the world.

The prism was created from a unique type of crystal found only in a now-lost mine deep within the cliffs of the Orosk Mountains. This crystal was known for its purity and its innate property to diffuse magical energies without corrupting them. The mages used an intricate array of enchantments to enhance this natural property, creating a powerful and versatile instrument for arcane experimentation.

## Truth

In actuality, the Prism is a myth. The object is a forgery created by [[Celdric Ambril]]. It was recently sold to someone heading to [[Zadash]]. It is currently in the possession of [[Korfel Withrethin|The Gentleman]].
