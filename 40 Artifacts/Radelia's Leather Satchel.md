# Radelia's Leather Satchel
On the road, the party discovers a torn leather pouch at the side of the road with some fresh bloodstains. The pouch is finely made and has the initials RC embossed on the flap. Inside the pouch they find:
- A small coin purse with 2 gp, 17 sp, and 31 cp
- A sewing kit (a DC 12 investigation check reveals that it is very high quality, something a trained professional would use; proficiency with any type of crafting tools gives advantage on this check)
- flint and steel
- a tortoiseshell comb (worth 2 sp)
- a set of thieves' tools
- a letter from Rinneth Starsong:
