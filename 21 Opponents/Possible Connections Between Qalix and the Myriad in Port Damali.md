Given the context that Vaud Qalix might have given the Blade of Maroth Fenn to another member of his entourage, thinking it was not particularly valuable, we can consider key individuals within his organization who might now possess the dagger. These individuals would likely be trusted allies or those holding significant roles within his operations.
### Likely Candidates:
1. **Valen Elderguard:**
- **Role:** Current leader of the Emissaries of the Sunfall.
- **Reason:** As a trusted ally and leader of a faction closely aligned with Qalix's goals, Valen might have received the dagger as a token of trust or for use in his covert operations.
2. **Zalthara Gikiaath:**
- **Role:** Militant member of the Xarzith Kitril Governing Council.
- **Reason:** Given her focus on securing the city's borders and her alignment with Qalix's views, Zalthara could have been given the dagger to aid in her defense efforts.
3. **[[Dreyara Drimvar]]:**
- **Role:** Spymaster within Qalix's network.
- **Reason:** As the head of espionage and intelligence, [[Dreyara Drimvar|Dreyara]] might possess the dagger for its utility in covert missions and self-defense.
4. **Densir Halrune:**
- **Role:** Head researcher and explorer locating the missing shards of the Lorestone of Eryndor.
- **Reason:** Densir's role in seeking out powerful artifacts might make him a suitable candidate for receiving the dagger, especially if Qalix thought it might aid in his explorations.
5. **Sirion Del'thane:**
- **Role:** Envoy coordinating negotiations with the Empire and the Dynasty.
- **Reason:** As a diplomat and negotiator, Sirion might have been given the dagger as a means of protection during his travels and negotiations.
### Conclusion:
Considering the roles and responsibilities of these individuals within Vaud Qalix's organization, **[[Dreyara Drimvar]], the Spymaster**, is the most likely candidate to possess the Blade of Maroth Fenn. Her position in charge of espionage and intelligence would make the dagger a valuable tool for her covert operations, and Qalix might have given it to her without realizing its full potential.

> Let's focus in on Rymmer. I suspect Qalix wants him to seek out the Lorestone shards. How might the alliance between Rymmer and [[Dreyara Drimvar|Dreyara]] impact the Clasp operations in the city in a way that it brings them into conflict?

### Alliance and Conflict Dynamics: Rymmer, [[Dreyara Drimvar|Dreyara]], and the Clasp

**Gabriel Rymmer**’s alliance with [[Dreyara Drimvar]] can significantly impact both the Myriad and the Clasp operations in [[Port Damali]], especially as it relates to the search for the Lorestone shards.

### Contributions and Actions by Rymmer

1. **Financial and Logistical Support**:
    
    - **Funding**: Rymmer’s auction house, the Exalted Collection, can generate substantial revenue by auctioning rare items and artifacts. This revenue can be funneled into Qalix’s plans, providing the necessary funds to acquire information and resources for locating the Lorestone shards.
    - **Logistics**: Rymmer can use his network to facilitate the transport and concealment of these artifacts, ensuring that any Lorestone shards or related items are moved discreetly and securely.
2. **Information Gathering**:
    
    - **Market Intelligence**: Rymmer’s connections in the black market and among collectors can provide valuable intelligence on the whereabouts of Lorestone shards and other significant items. He can leverage his network to gather leads and information that [[Dreyara Drimvar|Dreyara]] can act upon.
3. **Economic Manipulation**:
    
    - **Supply Chain Control**: Rymmer’s influence over commerce in [[Port Damali]] allows him to manipulate supply chains to favor the Myriad’s operations. This can involve restricting access to certain goods or facilitating the flow of specific items needed for Qalix’s plans.

### Impact on the Clasp

The alliance between Rymmer and [[Dreyara Drimvar|Dreyara]], driven by their mutual goal of locating the Lorestone shards, can bring them into direct conflict with the Clasp in several ways:

1. **Market Competition**:
    
    - **Resource Scarcity**: By controlling the supply and flow of valuable items and artifacts, Rymmer can create scarcity in the market, which could limit the resources available to the Clasp. This scarcity can lead to increased competition and tension between the two groups as they vie for control over limited goods.
2. **Undermining Operations**:
    
    - **Disruption of Smuggling Routes**: Rymmer’s economic influence can be used to disrupt the Clasp’s established smuggling routes. By manipulating market conditions or using his network to interfere with the Clasp’s logistics, Rymmer can create obstacles for the Clasp’s operations, leading to conflict.
    - **Intelligence Warfare**: As Rymmer and [[Dreyara Drimvar|Dreyara]] gather intelligence on the whereabouts of the Lorestone shards, they may uncover and exploit vulnerabilities in the Clasp’s network. This can involve exposing Clasp operatives or disrupting their information flow, leading to retaliatory actions.
3. **Direct Confrontation**:
    
    - **Assassinations and Sabotage**: The Clasp, known for its expertise in covert operations and assassinations, may respond to Rymmer’s actions with direct attacks. This could lead to a cycle of retaliation as both sides engage in sabotage and targeted killings to weaken each other’s influence.

### Potential Scenarios

- **Conflict Over Shards**: If Rymmer and [[Dreyara Drimvar|Dreyara]] identify a Lorestone shard within an area controlled by the Clasp, both factions may engage in a direct confrontation to secure the artifact. This could involve clandestine operations, theft, or even open conflict.
- **Economic Warfare**: Rymmer’s manipulation of the market to secure resources for Qalix’s plans could provoke the Clasp to take aggressive actions to regain control over their revenue streams. This might include sabotage of Rymmer’s business interests or attacks on shipments associated with his auction house.
- **Espionage and Counter-Espionage**: Both factions will likely engage in a battle of wits and information, with spies and counter-spies attempting to outmaneuver each other. [[Dreyara Drimvar|Dreyara]]’s expertise in espionage will be crucial in navigating and countering the Clasp’s efforts.

By leveraging Rymmer’s resources and [[Dreyara Drimvar|Dreyara]]’s expertise, Qalix can significantly advance his goals, albeit at the risk of igniting a conflict with the Clasp, whose operations in [[Port Damali]] would be severely threatened by this alliance. The ensuing struggle could reshape the power dynamics of the city, with both factions striving for dominance​.
