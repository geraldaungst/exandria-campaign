The phenomenon that the [[Emissaries of the Sunfall]] and [[Vaud Qalix]] are attempting to construct with the [[Lorestone of Eryndor]].

Components required:
- The complete Lorestone of Eryndor
- An [[Arcanist's Prism]] (which doesn't actually exist)
- Arboreal Heartwood
- Luxon Beacon
- live Phase Spider
- Gloomstalker ichor
- Residuum dust

Steps for construction:

1. Frame Construction:
   Craft a massive doorway frame using Arboreal Heartwood from an ancient treant. Carve planar stabilization runes into the wood and position it around the existing rift.

2. Beacon Preparation:
   Create a housing at the top of the frame for the Luxon Beacon. Install the Beacon, but don't activate it yet.

3. Coating Creation and Application:
   a) Capture a live Phase Spider.
   b) Cast True Polymorph on the Phase Spider, transforming it into a crystal. Maintain concentration for the full hour to make the transformation permanent.
   c) Grind the crystal into a fine powder.
   d) Mix the Phase Spider powder with Gloomstalker Ichor and Residuum dust.
   e) Apply this mixture to the inner surface of the wooden frame in multiple layers.

4. Conduit Creation:
   Carve a network of channels throughout the frame, connecting to the Beacon housing. These will serve as energy conduits.

5. Beacon Activation:
   Perform the ritual to activate the Luxon Beacon, initiating the flow of dunamantic energy through the frame's conduits.

6. Rift Synchronization:
   Use the Beacon's energy to synchronize the rift with the doorway frame, beginning the stabilization process.

7. Prism Integration and Activation:
   Install the Arcanist's Prism at the base of the doorway. Perform the final activation ritual, fully stabilizing the portal within the frame.

This process creates a Harmonic Planar Conduit that harnesses the Phase Spider's planar shifting abilities, the Luxon Beacon's dunamantic energy, and the stabilizing properties of the Arcanist's Prism to create a stable portal between planes.

In reality, the Lorestone cannot form such a conduit, and the attempt will fail. In the best possible circumstance, the rift will simply close, but at worst it could [[Lorestone of Eryndor#Lorestone Ritual of Closing|result in catastrophe]]. 

## **Vaud's Misunderstanding of the Requirements**

Vaud believes the Harmonic Planar Conduit requires seven specific components working in perfect harmony. However, his understanding is fundamentally flawed in several critical ways:

**The Arcanist's Prism Deception**: Vaud has been led to believe that an "Arcanist's Prism" is essential for the final stabilization process. In reality, no such artifact exists. The object he seeks from The Gentleman is a forgery created by Celdric Ambril. Ceratos has subtly influenced Vaud to pursue this non-existent component, knowing it will delay and ultimately doom the project.

**Misreading Rift Signatures**: Vaud interprets the random arcane noise around each rift as meaningful "signatures" that can be catalogued and predicted. He believes these patterns indicate the rift's origin plane and energy requirements. In truth, these are merely chaotic fluctuations that change constantly—there is no underlying pattern to decode or harness.

**Beacon Integration Fallacy**: While Vaud correctly understands that Luxon Beacons manipulate dunamancy, he incorrectly believes this energy can be "tuned" to specific planar frequencies. His research notes detail elaborate calculations for "harmonic resonance" between the Beacon and rift energies, but these calculations are based on false assumptions about how planar barriers function.

**Component Synergy Illusion**: Vaud's patron has fed him visions showing all seven components working together in a cascade of energy. These visions are deliberately misleading—Ceratos wants Vaud to believe success is possible while ensuring the actual attempt will create the chaos that feeds the Far Realm entity.

## **True Failure Conditions**

When Vaud attempts to construct the Harmonic Planar Conduit, several catastrophic outcomes are possible:

**Immediate Cascade Failure** (Most Likely): The moment the Luxon Beacon's dunamantic energy contacts the rift without proper understanding of planar mechanics, it will create a feedback loop. The Phase Spider crystal powder, instead of enabling planar shifting, will destabilize local space-time. The rift will expand rapidly, potentially consuming a radius of several miles before either stabilizing at a massive size or collapsing entirely.

**Temporal Fracture**: The combination of dunamantic energy and unstable planar boundaries could create temporal distortions. Anyone within the affected area might experience time loops, aging effects, or displacement to different time periods.

**Planar Inversion**: In the worst-case scenario, the failed ritual could invert the rift's polarity, turning it from a small breach into a permanent gateway that actively pulls material from the Material Plane into whatever plane lies beyond. This would create an ever-expanding zone of annihilation.

**Ceratos's True Victory**: Even if the rift simply closes, the massive release of chaotic energy from the failure will feed Ceratos significantly. The Far Realm entity has calculated that Vaud's defeat—especially a spectacular one—will generate enough chaos to finally give Ceratos the power to manifest directly on Exandria rather than working through proxies.
