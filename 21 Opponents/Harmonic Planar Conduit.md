The phenomenon that the [[Emissaries of the Sunfall]] and [[Vaud Qalix]] are attempting to construct with the [[Lorestone of Eryndor]].

Components required:
- The complete Lorestone of Eryndor
- An [[Arcanist's Prism]] (which doesn't actually exist)
- Arboreal Heartwood
- Luxon Beacon
- live Phase Spider
- Gloomstalker ichor
- Residuum dust

Steps for construction:

1. Frame Construction:
   Craft a massive doorway frame using Arboreal Heartwood from an ancient treant. Carve planar stabilization runes into the wood and position it around the existing rift.

2. Beacon Preparation:
   Create a housing at the top of the frame for the Luxon Beacon. Install the Beacon, but don't activate it yet.

3. Coating Creation and Application:
   a) Capture a live Phase Spider.
   b) Cast True Polymorph on the Phase Spider, transforming it into a crystal. Maintain concentration for the full hour to make the transformation permanent.
   c) Grind the crystal into a fine powder.
   d) Mix the Phase Spider powder with Gloomstalker Ichor and Residuum dust.
   e) Apply this mixture to the inner surface of the wooden frame in multiple layers.

4. Conduit Creation:
   Carve a network of channels throughout the frame, connecting to the Beacon housing. These will serve as energy conduits.

5. Beacon Activation:
   Perform the ritual to activate the Luxon Beacon, initiating the flow of dunamantic energy through the frame's conduits.

6. Rift Synchronization:
   Use the Beacon's energy to synchronize the rift with the doorway frame, beginning the stabilization process.

7. Prism Integration and Activation:
   Install the Arcanist's Prism at the base of the doorway. Perform the final activation ritual, fully stabilizing the portal within the frame.

This process creates a Harmonic Planar Conduit that harnesses the Phase Spider's planar shifting abilities, the Luxon Beacon's dunamantic energy, and the stabilizing properties of the Arcanist's Prism to create a stable portal between planes.

In reality, the Lorestone cannot form such a conduit, and the attempt will fail. In the best possible circumstance, the rift will simply close, but at worst it could [[Lorestone of Eryndor#Lorestone Ritual of Closing|result in catastrophe]].
