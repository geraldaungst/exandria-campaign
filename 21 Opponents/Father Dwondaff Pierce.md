> Before you stands a stout dwarf with a scraggly beard and warm, deep brown eyes. His dark brown hair, streaked with gray, is tied back neatly. He wears rich robes adorned with symbols of Avandra—interwoven paths, coins, and wheels—reflecting the goddess's domains of travel, trade, and luck. At his side hangs a belt with small charms, and in his hand, he carries a polished wooden staff topped with a brass coin, a symbol of Avandra's blessing. This is Father Dwondaff Pierce.

Father Dwondaff Pierce is a dwarven worshiper of Avandra, head of the Pearl Shrine.

It is widely rumored (correctly) that Father Dwondaff is the contact of [[Korfel Withrethin|The Gentleman]] in Port Damali.
