## The Lists (p. 70)

![[Vaud Qalix's Plan Outline#Core Information]]

### Resources
#### Existing
- 750 000 gp in a storehouse (in fact a previously undiscovered portion of Vorugal's hoard, supplemented with funds embezzled from the [[Scars of Scale and Tooth|Xarzith Kitril council]]) in the Ruins of Draconia.
- 10 spies located around Exandria
- 75 researchers seeking information on the shards
- 12 arcane magic users investigating how to stabilize the rifts with the Lorestone (to be led by a [[Iliara Firth|Chronurgy Wizard]] not yet recruited by Qalix).
- 5 other Villains heading up specific parts of his operation:
	- [[Sirion Del'thane]] - Envoy coordinating negotiations with the Empire and the Dynasty (though each side does not know the other is beeing wooed)
	- [[Densir Halrune]] - Head researcher and explorer locating the missing shards
	- Spymaster [[Dreyara Drimvar]]
	- [[Thok-Kynn Dalca]] - Treasurer
	- [[Quyx the Stonebinder]] - Experienced architect and stonemason who is in charge of rebuilding Draconia.
#### Needed
- Location of Shards 7 and 8
- Components from the Elemental Planes to cleanse the shards
- A Chronurgy Wizard to develop the magic needed to weave the shards together - This will be Magister [[Iliara Firth]], recruited from the Cerberus Assembly.
- A large enough rift to supply the power he needs - This will eventually appear in the Savalirwood


![[What does Vaud Qalix want#Core Information]]

## What Vaud Qalix doesn't know...
[[Ceratos|Ceratos]] is not merely the source of his power. [[Ceratos|Ceratos]] is using him to create chaos and increase their power. [[Ceratos|Ceratos]] knows he will eventually be defeated, but that defeat will unleash a very desirable wave of chaos that will finally give [[Ceratos|Ceratos]] enough power and coherence to act directly in Exandria instead of manipulating mortals.

Not only this, but the rifts he believes are part of a larger pattern are in fact random and chaotic. What Qalix thinks is a "signature" for each rift is merely the specific random variation of arcane noise that happens to exist at that spot at that moment. Over time, the noise shifts and changes, and there is no way to actually associate a specific pattern with a specific rift.

## The Sentence
*Vaud wants to assemble the [[Lorestone of Eryndor]] before war breaks out between the Kryn Dynasty and the Dwendalian Empire, but he is having difficulty acquiring the obsidian shards via his network of spies and collectors because of the interference of the player characters.*

[[Lyren Willowwhisper]] holds 4 shards. Other [[Lorestone of Eryndor#Known Shards\|shards]] exist, but Qalix does not yet know where they are. | Qalix thinks that war will limit his influence and power as resources are poured into the fight.                                     | The Obsidian Echoforge is seeking these items as well and has centuries of research and experience. | Qalix has allied himself with both the Myriad and the Clasp as well as building his own private network of mercenaries and researchers.                 | The Players.                                                                                                 |                                                                                                  |

Too late and Qalix may miss the opportunity to bring Draconia back.                     | The [[01 The Prophecy                                                                               | prophecy]] is incomplete and has been misunderstood, so no one even knows how many more shards exist.                                                   | Qalix is diverting funds from the operation of Xarzith Kitril and selling contraband to fund his operations. | Collecting all of the shards or interfering with Qalix's plans will prevent him from succeeding. |
| Where...                  | Xarzith Kitril / Ruins of Draconia                                                   | Four shards are with [[Lyren Willowwhisper]]. One shard is in Rexxentrum. One shard is in Marquet.

| When...                   | When he realized the council was spinning its wheels.                                | Once all the pieces are found and collected, the stone can be reassembled.                                                                                                                                                   | If war breaks out, Qalix will continue to seek the Lorestone but will probably change tactics.                                       | This is an ongoing problem.                                                                         | Qalix will continue to build his network as long as he has not completed his goal. He gives empty promises of power to those who don't want just money. | PCs will begin accumulating information that will lead them to Qalix eventually.                             |                                                                                                  |
| Why...                    | Draconia was dealt an unfair fate and deserves to be restored to its destined glory. | Qalix wants its power to raise himself up as a world leader to restore Draconia.                                                                                                                                             | Qalix wants Draconia to be the "hero" in preventing the war, raising his status worldwide.                                           | The information to locate the shards is cryptic and fragmented.                                     | Qalix cannot do this alone and cannot trust honest people. The sycophants are the most reliable.                                                        | The PCs will have to decide which of the factions to support.                                                |                                                                                                  |
