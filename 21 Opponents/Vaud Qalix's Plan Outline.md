# Core Information

## Plan Outline
1. [ ] Acquire the 2 known shards of the [[Lorestone of Eryndor]] not held by the [[Obsidian Echoforge]]
	- [ ] Steal the shard from the Rexxentrum Archive (assigned to [[Dreyara Drimvar]])
	- [ ] Buy the shard from [[Celdric Ambril]]
2. [ ] Seek and recover the missing shards.
3. [ ] Trick [[Lyren Willowwhisper]] into handing over her four shards - or kill her and take them if absolutely necessary
4. [ ] Obtain the other materials needed for the [[Harmonic Planar Conduit]]:
	- [ ] Arboreal Heartwood
	- [ ] Luxon Beacon
	- [ ] live Phase Spider
	- [ ] Gloomstalker ichor
	- [ ] Residuum dust
	- [ ] [[Arcanist's Prism]] from [[Korfel Withrethin|The Gentleman]]
1. [ ] Conduct the assembly ritual and construct a stable [[Harmonic Planar Conduit]]
2. [ ] Siphon the energy from a rift to feed his patron and increase Qalix's power
3. [ ] Begin restoring the Ruins of Draconia
4. [ ] Leverage existing alliances by demonstrating the new power of Draconia
5. [ ] Declare himself [[Vaud Qalix|Dawnbringer of the New Draconian Dominion]].

## Obstacles
- The [[Obsidian Echoforge]] will not willingly release the shards
- [[Archivist Ovedo]] will carefully protect the shard in their care
- Two shards have yet to be discovered
- The [[Ashari Riftguard]] and [[Malachite Cord]] are going to get in the way
- Defending the rifts from creatures coming through from other planes

## **Vaud's Incomplete Understanding**

While Vaud believes his plan is methodical and well-researched, his understanding contains several critical gaps that will ultimately doom his efforts:

**Misidentified Component Requirements**: Vaud's list includes the "Arcanist's Prism," which he believes is crucial for energy dispersal. He has invested significant resources pursuing this artifact through The Gentleman, unaware that it's a forgery and that no such magical item actually exists. This fundamental error was planted by Ceratos through subtle manipulations and false visions.

**Oversimplified Lorestone Assembly**: Vaud assumes that simply possessing all eight shards will allow him to reconstruct the complete Lorestone. He lacks understanding of the specific ritual requirements, the temporal constraints involved, or the fact that several shards may have been corrupted beyond use. His plan treats the assembly as a straightforward puzzle rather than the complex magical undertaking it truly represents.

**Flawed Rift Theory**: Central to Vaud's strategy is his belief that rifts follow predictable patterns he can decode and exploit. His research notes are filled with charts mapping "rift signatures" and "planar resonance frequencies." In reality, these readings represent random chaotic fluctuations. Vaud's patron has encouraged this misinterpretation to ensure his eventual failure will be spectacular.

**Underestimated Opposition**: While Vaud acknowledges that the Obsidian Echoforge, Ashari Riftguard, and Malachite Cord will oppose him, he believes their resistance stems from ignorance or fear rather than legitimate understanding. He assumes that demonstrating the Conduit's power will convert them to his cause, not realizing that they oppose him because they correctly understand the catastrophic risks involved.

**Patron Relationship Delusion**: Most critically, Vaud believes his patron "the voice beyond the veil" shares his goals of restoring Draconia and bringing order to the rifts. He interprets Ceratos's guidance as coming from a benevolent entity that wants to see him succeed. Vaud doesn't realize he's being manipulated into creating precisely the kind of chaotic catastrophe that will feed his Far Realm patron.

**Timeline Pressures**: Vaud feels urgency about completing his plan before war breaks out between the Kryn Dynasty and the Dwendalian Empire, believing this conflict will complicate his resource acquisition. However, he fails to understand that his patron actually wants the plan to fail during wartime, as the additional chaos of military conflict will amplify the energy Ceratos can harvest from the catastrophe.

**Resource Management Blind Spots**: Despite his substantial treasury and network of agents, Vaud has overcommitted resources to pursuing non-existent or impossible objectives. His 12 arcane researchers are studying flawed theories, his 75 artifact seekers are chasing false leads, and his spies are gathering intelligence based on fundamentally incorrect assumptions about how planar magic functions.
