|            |                               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| Occupation | Great Old One                 |
| Goal       | Increase chaos to gain power  |
| Attitude   | Superiority                   |
| Stake      | Nothing else matters. All in. |

## What does the Nemesis want?
To gain power through Chaos.

## The Sentence
*Ceratos wants a permanent, unstable rift to the Far Realm before anyone discovers the true nature of the rifts on Exandria, and is having difficulty getting their warlock thralls to connect and destablize the existing rifts because the PCs keep either closing or stabilizing them.*

## Psychology of the Nemesis
The Never-Present Nemesis (working through the Apparent Nemesis and other Villains)

Abilities:

Discorporation. When <Name of Deity> drops to 0 hit points or dies, <his or her> body is destroyed, but <his or her> essence travels back to <his or her> domain in <Home Plane>, and <he or she> is unable to take physical form for a time.

Innate Spellcasting (3/Day). <Name of Deity> can innately cast <Any 7th Level Spell or Higher> (Suggestion: The default choice would be Divine Word, but spells like Control Weather, Earthquake, Meteor Swarm, Time Stop, and True Polymorph are all great choices, depending on the Domain, or pick Wish if one wants to go all-powerful) (Spell Save DC 26) (For spells that require it). <His or Her> spellcasting ability is Charisma.

Legendary Resistance (5/Day). If <Name of Deity> fails a Saving Throw, <he or she> can choose to succeed instead.

Limited Magic Immunity. Unless <he or she> wishes to be affected, <Name of Deity> is immune to spells of 6th level or lower. <He or She> has advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects.

Magic Weapons. <Name of Deity>’s weapon attacks are magical.

Multiple Reactions. <Name of Deity> can take one reaction per turn, rather than only one per round. <He or She> also has advantage on saving throws against being knocked unconscious. If <he or she> fails a saving throw against an effect that would stun a creature, one of <his or her> unspent Legendary Actions is spent.

Regeneration. <Name of Deity> regains 30 Hit Points at the start of <his or her> turn.

Actions:

Change Shape (1/Day). <Name of Deity> magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than <his or her> own, or back into <his or her> true form. When <Name of Deity> drops to 0 hit points or dies, <his or her> body is destroyed, but <his or her> essence travels back to <his or her> domain in <Home Plane>, and <he or she> is unable to take physical form for a time. Any equipment <he or she> is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (<Name of Deity>’s choice). In a new form, <Name of Deity> retains <his or her> Ability Scores, Alignment, Hit Points, Hit Dice, Innate Spellcasting, Legendary Resistance, Limited Magical Immunity, ability to speak, Senses, Proficiencies, as well as this Action, but <his or her> AC, movement modes, and other Actions and Legendary Actions are replaced by those of the new form, and <Name of Deity> gains any statistics and capabilities (except Class Features, Legendary Actions, and Lair Actions) that the new form has but that <Name of Deity> lacks.

Multiattack. <Name of Deity> can use <his or her> Frightful Presence. <He or She> then makes three attacks: two with <his or her> <fists, claws or other limb>, and one with <his or her> <foot, tail or other appendage>.

<Fist or Claw>. Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to Hit, Reach 15ft., one target. Hit: 24 (4d6 +10) <Bludgeoning or Slashing> Damage

<Foot or Tail>. Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to Hit, Reach 25ft., one target. Hit: 28 (4d8 +10) <Bludgeoning or Piercing> Damage

Frightful Presence. Each creature of <Name of Deity>’s choice that is within 240 feet of <Name of Deity> and aware of <him or her> must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom Saving Throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful, or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to <Name of Deity>’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

Legendary Actions:

<Name of Deity> can take 5 Legendary Actions, choosing from the options below. Only one Legendary Action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature’s turn. <Name of Deity> regains spent Legendary Actions at the start of <his or her> turn.

<Name of Deity>’s Legendary Action options are associated with <Fluff Reason> (Suggestion: Let each damage type and ability reflect the Deity’s Domains; personally, I’d choose the standard one to be a melee weapon associated with the deity, and the rest can be elemental attacks that the same weapon can emit). Once <Name of Deity> chooses a Legendary Action option for one of <Fluff Reason>, <he or she> can’t choose another one associated with that <Fluff Reason> until the start of her next turn.

<Weapon Associated with Deity>. Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to Hit, Reach 20ft., one target. Hit: 32 (4d10 +10) <Appropriate Damage Type> Damage plus 14 (4d6) <Appropriate Damage Type> Damage (<Weapon Aspect 1>), <Appropriate Damage Type> Damage (<Weapon Aspect 2>), <Appropriate Damage Type> Damage (<Weapon Aspect 3>), <Appropriate Damage Type> Damage (<Weapon Aspect 4>), or <Appropriate Damage Type> Damage (<Weapon Aspect 5>)

<Weapon Aspect 1>: <Appropriate Damage Type Aspect> (Costs 2 Actions). <Weapon Associated with Deity> emits <Appropriate Damage Type> in a 120 foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 27 <Appropriate Ability Score> Saving Throw, taking 67 (15d8) <Appropriate Damage Type> Damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
