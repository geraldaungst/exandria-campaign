# Core Information
## History of Xarzith Kitril and Draconia

### **Xarzith Kitril:**
- **Founding and Early History:** Xarzith Kitril, translating to "Cold Jewel" in Draconic, was established as a city of resilience and unity after the fall of the original Draconia. It became a refuge for the Dragonborn who survived the attack by the Chroma Conclave. 
- **Growth and Development:** The city grew into a significant settlement with a blend of draconic architectural marvels and practical defensive structures, maintaining a strong sense of cultural heritage. The city's architecture reflects its harsh environment with buildings designed to withstand the elements and intricate carvings depicting Dragonborn history.
- **Council of Elders:** Governed by a council of elders, Xarzith Kitril has always been seen as a beacon of hope and perseverance. The council, although well-intentioned, has been criticized for its cautious approach and lack of visionary leadership【13†source】.

### **Draconia:**
- **Golden Age:** Draconia was once a powerful and affluent nation, known for its breathtaking spires, advanced magical practices, and unparalleled martial prowess. It was a land where Dragonborn thrived, their society a testament to the harmonious blend of magic and might【13†source】.
- **Fall of Draconia:** The nation's downfall came with the assault of the Chroma Conclave, a coalition of powerful chromatic dragons that decimated Draconia, reducing its grand cities to ruins and scattering its people【13†source】.
- **Legacy and Ruins:** The ruins of Draconia serve as a haunting reminder of its former glory. Many Dragonborn, including ambitious leaders like Vaud Qalix, see the restoration of Draconia as their ultimate goal. These ruins are not just historical artifacts but also a symbol of potential resurgence and a cornerstone for future endeavors【13†source】【12†source】.

### **Restoration Efforts:**
- **Visionary Leadership:** Figures like Vaud Qalix have emerged, advocating for a new vision of Draconian resurgence. Qalix’s manifesto outlines a grand plan to harness the chaotic energies of the rifts and reassemble the Lorestone of Eryndor, believing these actions will restore Draconia to its destined glory【13†source】.
- **Challenges and Alliances:** The path to restoration is fraught with challenges, including opposition from various factions and the inherent dangers of manipulating arcane rift energies. Strategic alliances and the gathering of scattered Lorestone shards are crucial steps in Qalix's plan【13†source】.

### **Current State:**
- **Cultural Resilience:** Despite the hardships, the Dragonborn of Xarzith Kitril and those scattered across Exandria hold on to their cultural identity and historical pride. The spirit of Draconia lives on in their hearts, driving their ambition and unity【13†source】.
- **Political and Arcane Struggles:** The ongoing struggle for power and the intricate plans to control rift energies depict a turbulent yet hopeful scenario. The eventual goal remains the same: to see Draconia rise from its ashes and reclaim its place as a dominant force in Exandria【12†source】【13†source】.
