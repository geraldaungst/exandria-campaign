# Core Information
## Timeline of Draconia

**c. 400 PD**
- **Founding of Draconia:** The Dragonborn establish Draconia on the floating islands above the Dreemoth Ravine. Draconia quickly becomes known for its architectural marvels and advanced magical prowess, thriving as a powerful and affluent nation.

**400 PD - 812 PD**
- **Golden Age of Draconia:** Draconia experiences a period of significant growth and cultural development. The nation is a hub of draconic culture and civilization, with its spires reaching towards the heavens and its people mastering the arts of magic and warfare.

**811 PD**
- **Attack of the Chroma Conclave:** The Chroma Conclave, a group of powerful chromatic dragons led by Thordak the Cinder King, launches a devastating assault on Draconia. The cities are destroyed, many Dragonborn are killed, and the surviving Dragonborn are scattered across Exandria. The attack marks the end of Draconiaâ€™s golden age and its transformation into a series of ruins.

**811 PD - 836 PD**
- **Scattering and Survival:** The surviving Dragonborn seek refuge in various parts of Exandria. The most notable settlement of survivors is Xarzith Kitril, where the Dragonborn work to preserve their cultural heritage and rebuild their society in the wake of Draconia's destruction.

**c. 836 PD**
- **Present Day:** Leaders like Vaud Qalix emerge with ambitions to restore Draconia to its former glory. Qalix seeks to harness the chaotic energies of the rifts and reassemble the Lorestone of Eryndor. The ruins of Draconia symbolize both a tragic past and the hope for a resurgence, as efforts to reclaim and restore the nation intensify amid various challenges and opposition.
