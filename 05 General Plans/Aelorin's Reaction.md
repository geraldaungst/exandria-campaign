# Core Information
## [[Aelorin Nightshade|Aelorin]]'s Reaction
Following the failure, [[Aelorin Nightshade|Aelorin]]'s response was a bit unsurprised or even indifferent. Rather than anger or disappointment, his reaction, though it was a beating, was cold. He explained that she was so pathetic, he was not surprised that she failed so miserably before he threw her out. [[Qilynn Duskwhisper (Nicole)|Qilynn]] does not suspect [[Aelorin Nightshade|Aelorin]], but has a hunch it was another thief in her midst who might have conspired against her - [[Aelorin Nightshade|Aelorin]]â€™s favorite, [[Yrene Shadowthorn]].
