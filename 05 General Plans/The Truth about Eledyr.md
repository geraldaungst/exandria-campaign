# Core Information
## The Truth about Eledyr
In actual fact, it was another young apprentice of [[Aelorin Nightshade|Aelorin]] who set up [[Qilynn Duskwhisper (Nicole)|Qilynn]]: [[Eledyr Dephar]]. Eledyr still holds a grudge from an early encounter when [[Qilynn Duskwhisper (Nicole)|Qilynn]] shared some honest but blunt feedback about a training mission. Eledyr was tasked with a stealth reconnaissance mission to gather intelligence on a rival faction's activities. This mission required precise movement, silent observation, and detailed reporting.

After the mission, Qilynn casually remarked, "Your footsteps were too loud, and you left a trail anyone could follow. You need to work on moving more quietly if you want to be useful in the field."

To Qilynn, this was just routine advice, but to Eledyr, it felt like a public humiliation that highlighted his inadequacies in front of their peers. Eledyr believes that [[Qilynn Duskwhisper (Nicole)|Qilynn]] was trying to embarrass and shame him, and found his opportunity to get her back when [[Qilynn Duskwhisper (Nicole)|Qilynn]]'s "final exam" came up.

Yrene never felt guilty. Her actions were actually a result of her romantic feelings towards [[Qilynn Duskwhisper (Nicole)|Qilynn]] (which [[Qilynn Duskwhisper (Nicole)|Qilynn]] was never aware of).
