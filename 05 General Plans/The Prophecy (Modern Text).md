# Core Information
## The Prophecy (Modern Text)
*As it exists today based on some fragments that have been found to date as well as recorded legends.*

Three emblems stand 'neath destiny's watch, their fate in time's torn seam,  
The crown ablaze, with watchful gaze, sees rifts' converging stream.  
The shield of old, in legends bold, stands 'gainst the threatening blight,  
The tree's deep roots, in earth's resolute, brace for a world in twilight.

Stars drawn close in cosmic breach, realms merge in ominous plight,  
Secrets told in twilight's fold, forewarn a direful night.
From the dark, a Beacon's light! Straddling dusk and dawn,  
Does her beam herald hope's bright sight, or catastrophe anon?  

Echoing tales from lofty spires, now hushed the woods that mourn,  
A hidden path, by moon's red wrath, to a future with rifts torn.  
The cosmic scale--Exandria's fate--wavers in day's decline,  
Will it lean towards dawning hope, or night where stars align?
