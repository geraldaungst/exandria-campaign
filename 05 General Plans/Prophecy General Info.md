# Core Information
## Prophecy General Info
> 
> 1. Rifts have begun to appear across Wildemount. Some people believe these rifts are symbolic and have a pattern. They in fact are chaotic and random, and the efforts seeking to understand the patterns will ultimately prove fruitless.
> 2. Deep beneath the [[Ruins of Molaesmyr]] is a Fey Crossing. About 250 years ago, the elves excavating beneath the city discovered the Crossing. An unknown accident triggered an event that caused the destruction of the city and most of its residents at the time.
> 3. A [[01 The Prophecy|prophecy]] exists (see below) that describes what many have interpreted to be three groups or factions that would arise and struggle for control of the rifts.
> 4. The prophecy speaks of a "beacon" that will seal the rift. One group of scholars, the [[Obsidian Echoforge]],  believes that the [[Lorestone of Eryndor]] itself is the beacon, and they are seeking to assemble the shards. (This group is the "Tree" of the prophecy.) (One of the passengers from Emon was a [[Aethor Kalisk|member of this group]] and had a lead on someone in [[Port Damali]] who may have more information about the location of a missing shard.)
> 	- This group is partly correct--the Lorestone does need to be assembled, but it is not the beacon. It requires a [[luxon-beacon-egw|Luxon Beacon]] to function properly to close rifts.
> 5. A second group ([[Malachite Cord]]) believe the efforts to disperse the energy will actually enhance it, and that the presence of the "beacon" will instead *cause* the rift to open further. The Cord will be working to prevent the [[Obsidian Echoforge]] from succeeding in their quest and are instead researching divine magical means of closing the unstable rifts. (This group is the "Shield" of the prophecy.) (Another skyship passenger was a member of this group, spying on the first.)
> 	- This group is also partly correct. The Lorestone alone will in fact destabilize rifts and cause them to become more chaotic. The cataclysm in Molaesmyr was the result of a similar event (though not connected with the Lorestone). 
> 6. A third group ([[Emissaries of the Sunfall]]) believes that the openings between planes are an opportunity and a sign that the gods are going to return to Exandria. They believe the rift can (and should) be controlled. They have reason to think a permanent doorway can be constructed via mechanical and arcane means, but the magic needed to make it work was lost after the Divergence. They are seeking pre-Calamity knowledge and artifacts and assembling a team of arcane and divine scholars hoping to solve the mystery before the event. (They are not yet aware of [[Aveqtaro Thaan]], but when they learn of her, they will conclude she is a key to their success.) They will also be working to stop both the other groups from succeeding. (This group is the "Crown" in the prophecy.)
> 	- This group is wrong--the rifts are chaotic and cannot be controlled.
> 7. It will eventually turn out that the hijackers were part of the [[Emissaries of the Sunfall|Emissaries]], and the hijacking was intended to divert the first group.
> 8. The [[Emissaries of the Sunfall|Emissaries]] are not aware of the Cord yet, and the hijackers did not know about their spy on the skyship. Neither the [[Obsidian Echoforge]] or the Cord are aware of the [[Emissaries of the Sunfall|Emissaries]] splinter group.
