# Core Information
## The Prophecy (Original Form)
(Lines in bold italics will be found on later shards of the [[Lorestone of Eryndor]] over the course of the campaign.)

Where once-grand spires whispered tales, now silent groves foretell,
***[[Lorestone of Eryndor#^shard6|Wildmother's care and Arch Heart's grace could not corruption quell.]]***
Worlds align and form a breach, in realms both stark and shrouded,
***[[Lorestone of Eryndor#^shard6|Secrets loom, in twilight's reach, as cosmic paths are clouded.]]***

Three symbols rise 'neath fate's keen eye, each drawn to rifts' grand strand,
The fiery crown, with fervent cry, seeks dominion o'er the land.
The vigilant shield, in lore deep, guards 'gainst the gathering night,
The verdant tree, in wisdom's keep, absorbs Exandria's plight.

***[[Lorestone of Eryndor#^shard7|In the abyss, a beacon bright, its fate a mysterious stone,]]***
Is this gleam a guiding light, or a signal of danger unknown?
***[[Lorestone of Eryndor#^shard7|Order and chaos, in union move, as the rifts' song grows strong,]]***
Their chorus may a new world prove, or a requiem's final song.

***[[Lorestone of Eryndor#^shard8|On destiny's edge, a task unfolds, to reforge wisdom's Key,]]***
***[[Lorestone of Eryndor#^shard8|Its whispers hold a fate untold, in time's final decree.]]***
In cosmic scales, where truths do sway, Exandria's fate's at play,
Will it turn towards dawn's bright ray, or endless disarray?
