# Story Beats for Planning
## Short Term
- [ ] [[Drawg Stormbrew (Brew)|Drawg]] needs to acquire his [[Blade of Maroth Fenn|dagger]]...currently held by [[Dreyara Drimvar]]
- [x] ...and [[Drawg Stormbrew (Brew)|Drawg]] also wants a trident
- [x] [[Drawg Stormbrew (Brew)|Drawg]] has promised to help with the [[New Temple of Moradin]]
- [ ] [[Hesterian Shyr (Dot)|Hesterian]] will infiltrate the Myriad, but doing so will compel her to commit evil acts.
- [x] [[Hesterian Shyr (Dot)|Hesterian]] wants to visit the [[Harmony Hall|Coriander & Mallow Exchange Company]].
- [x] [[Qilynn Duskwhisper (Nicole)|Qilynn]] knows damn well that her [[21 Qilynn's Failed Heist|last failure was not her fault]], but she can't prove it. It's just a hunch. When she figures out who sabotaged the gig, she owes them. Her revenge may cause unexpected complications for her and for the party.
- [x] [[Seraphina Amaris (Vicki)|Seraphina]] wants to find out what century it is, and how to fit into this new reality. The discovery will turn her world upside down.
- [ ] [[Popcorn Zikelfikel (Viv)|Popcorn]] really wants to prove himself physically in a fight to show that he can hold his own as a barbarian. Because of his size and typically sweet nature, he is not taken seriously in that regard so doing something awesome in a fight and getting praise for it would make him feel validated.
- [x] [[Laucian Greycastle (Brent)|Laucian]] has a [[Letter to Celdric Ambril]] to deliver
- [ ] [[Eidechse (Amanda Jeane)|Dechs]] - Complete her assignment to obtain the rare herbs and return them to [[Zadash]] for payment

## Medium Term
- [ ] [[Drawg Stormbrew (Brew)|Drawg]] will go back to Bahamut and epically leave [[Elby Cinderdash (Brew)|Elby]] in the hands of the party (somewhere around Level 7).
- [ ] [[Elby Cinderdash (Brew)|Elby]] will find/earn a [[sun-blade|Sun Blade]].
- [ ] [[Hesterian Shyr (Dot)|Hesterian]] will discover who [[The Capture of Melthes|took her sibling away]] (the [[Cerberus Assembly]]) which will set political events beyond her control into motion. As part of this, she will discover the meaning of the [[Hesterian Shyr (Dot)#Mysterious Secret|vision she is having]].
- [ ] [[Qilynn Duskwhisper (Nicole)|Qilynn]] wants to prove that she's actually a damn good thief. She's had a run of bad luck getting caught on some big jobs, so she's looking for the next big gig - maybe bigger than it needs to be to prove herself. She specifically want to prove herself to [[Aelorin Nightshade|Aelorin]] - both to show him up and to be accepted by him. Once she does this, [[Aelorin Nightshade|Aelorin]] will reconsider and could potentially become an ally for the party.
- [ ] [[Seraphina Amaris (Vicki)|Seraphina]] wants to find out [[Rupture of the Molaesmyr Fey Crossing|what cursed the woods]], and is there any way for her to fix/save my homeland. Discovering this will reveal a darker plot than she is expecting.
