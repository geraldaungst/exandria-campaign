# Core Information
## A Suspect for [[Qilynn Duskwhisper (Nicole)|Qilynn]]
[[Yrene Shadowthorn]] is a fellow rogue who trained alongside [[Qilynn Duskwhisper (Nicole)|Qilynn]] under [[Aelorin Nightshade|Aelorin]]'s tutelage. Unlike [[Qilynn Duskwhisper (Nicole)|Qilynn]], Yrene was favored by [[Aelorin Nightshade|Aelorin]] and a full elf, earning his approval and special attention.

As [[Qilynn Duskwhisper (Nicole)|Qilynn]] observed the dynamics within their small circle of the Clasp, she couldn't shake the feeling that Yrene harbored jealousy and resentment toward her. Yrene's proficiency in both stealth and magic made her a standout pupil, and [[Qilynn Duskwhisper (Nicole)|Qilynn]] sensed a competitive edge in their interactions as well as was suspect of a potential romantic relationship between Yrene and [[Aelorin Nightshade|Aelorin]].

After the heist went awry, [[Qilynn Duskwhisper (Nicole)|Qilynn]] recalled subtle signs that pointed to Yrene's involvement - a lingering gaze that betrayed guilt and the sudden absence of Yrene regularly during critical missions prior. [[Qilynn Duskwhisper (Nicole)|Qilynn]] started piecing together instances where Yrene had access to sensitive information about the artifact heist, making her a prime suspect in orchestrating the setup.

[[Qilynn Duskwhisper (Nicole)|Qilynn]]'s suspicion adds a layer of personal vendetta to her quest for redemption. She is not only seeking to prove her worth and skills but is also determined to expose Yrene's betrayal and clear her name from the tarnish of failure that has been cast upon her.
