# Core Information
## Qilynn's Final Mission
[[Qilynn Duskwhisper (Nicole)|Qilynn]]'s last mission had the aura of calculated betrayal or a set-up lingering around it. She meticulously planned the heist of the prized artifact, driven by a desire to win back [[Aelorin Nightshade]]'s favor. However, several details emerged that led her to suspect a setup:

### Unforeseen Security Measures
Unexpectedly sophisticated security measures were in place, ones she hadn't been briefed on or trained to tackle. It was as though someone anticipated her every move, suggesting insider knowledge or manipulation.

### Unexplained Changes
There were unaccounted-for changes in the artifact's location or the guards' shifts, details that had been meticulously researched and confirmed prior to the mission. The sudden alterations made her question the reliability of her information.
