# Core Information

## Rylan Estevez Frame Job

### **The Victim**

[[Rylan Estevez]] was an 18-year-old stable boy who worked at [[Harmony Hall]] when it operated as [[Grisul Adder]]'s brothel in [[Port Damali]]. He was known to be honest, hardworking, and had developed an innocent friendship with [[Xanaphia Lothliss]], one of the performers.

### **The Frame-Up**

**Perpetrator:** [[Korfel Withrethin]]  
**Timing:** Immediately after the [[Port Damali Murders]]  
**Method:** False tip to authorities with planted evidence

**How it worked:**

- After murdering [[Hesterian Shyr (Dot)]] and [[Xanaphia Lothliss]], Korfel needed to deflect suspicion from himself
- He gave authorities a "tip" pointing to Rylan as the murderer
- The murder weapon (knife used to slash Hesterian's throat) was planted on or near Rylan
- Korfel used Xanaphia's lie about "fleeing with the stable boy" as the foundation for the false accusation

### **The False Evidence**

**Primary Evidence:** Bloody knife found with Rylan  
**Circumstantial Evidence:**

- Rylan's access to the brothel and knowledge of the women
- His known friendship with Xanaphia (twisted into "romantic involvement")
- No alibi for the time of murders (young man living alone)

**Evidence of Innocence (Overlooked):**

- Rylan's leather bracelet with crescent moon symbol and "XL" initials - a gift from Xanaphia proving their innocent friendship, not romantic conspiracy
- No investigation into Rylan's character or past behavior
- No examination of Korfel's motive or whereabouts
- Rushed investigation due to "clear evidence" and public pressure

### **The Conviction**

**Trial:** Quick conviction based on planted evidence and false testimony  
**Sentence:** 10 years in prison  
**Current Status:** Still serving sentence, approximately 7-8 years remaining  
**Location:** [[Port Damali]] prison system

### **Rylan's Current State**

- **Physical condition:** Gaunt, sickly appearance from years of imprisonment
- **Mental state:** Bitter, hopeless, but maintains innocence
- **Knowledge:** Has no information about the actual crime beyond knowing he was falsely accused
- **Only lead:** Knows the name of his accuser (Korfel Withrethin)
- **Treasured possession:** Still wears the leather bracelet from Xanaphia, evidence of their innocent connection

### **Impact on Rylan**

- Lost his youth and future to a crime he didn't commit
- Isolated from family and community who may believe his guilt
- Struggles with bitterness and despair but hasn't lost his core decency
- Represents collateral damage from Korfel's self-preservation

### **Justice Implications**

**Exonerating Evidence:**

- Testimony from the true perpetrator (Korfel)
- Investigation into Korfel's actual motive and opportunity
- The bracelet as proof of innocent relationship with Xanaphia
- Witnesses who could place Korfel at the scene

**Legal Ramifications:**

- Overturning the conviction would expose massive judicial failure
- Compensation issues for wrongful imprisonment
- Political scandal if frame-up becomes public knowledge
- Could destabilize public trust in [[Port Damali]] law enforcement

**Personal Stakes:**

- Rylan deserves freedom and restoration of his name
- His continued imprisonment perpetuates Korfel's crime
- Time sensitivity: every day in prison is additional injustice
