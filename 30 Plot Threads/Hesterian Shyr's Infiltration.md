> 
> - Stage: Seed (player-expressed goal, needs opportunity)
> - Priority: Medium
> - Timeline: Player-driven, connected to journey north
> - Key Players: [[Hesterian Shyr (Dot)]], [[Korfel Withrethin]], [[Myriad]]

# Overview

Hesterian has expressed the goal of infiltrating the Myriad criminal organization. Unknown to her, this quest will lead her directly to the man who murdered her - [[Korfel Withrethin]], who now operates as "The Gentleman" and runs [[The Gentleman's Criminal Empire]] in [[Zadash]]. The central dramatic tension lies in the immediate recognition between murderer and victim, forcing complex choices about revenge, justice, and survival.

**Core Dramatic Question:** When Hesterian meets her killer face-to-face in a position of power, how will she choose between immediate revenge and strategic patience?

# Current State

## Recent Events

- Hesterian visited [[Harmony Hall]] and confronted [[Grisul Adder]]
- Learned some details about events after [[The Port Damali Murders]]
- Established that she's seeking her killer and has leads pointing north

## Active Elements

- Player has expressed interest in Myriad infiltration
- Hesterian knows [[Korfel Withrethin]] fled north, possibly to [[Zadash]]
- Geographic progression brings party closer to Zadash/northern regions
- Potential connection to [[Eidechse (Amanda Jeane)|Dechs]]'s herb delivery mission

## Blocking Issues

- No immediate catalyst for beginning infiltration
- Party currently focused on other objectives
- Hesterian hasn't connected Myriad infiltration to revenge quest yet

# Player Knowledge

## What Hesterian Knows:

- **Her Murder:** Full details in [[The Port Damali Murders]]
- **Current Lead:** Killer fled north, possibly to [[Zadash]]
- **Infiltration Goal:** Wants to infiltrate the Myriad (player choice)
- **Mysterious Visions:** Strange dreams about "Scourger" and flames from [[stone-of-memory]]

## What Hesterian Thinks She Knows:

- Korfel is probably still using his original name
- Her infiltration of the Myriad is unrelated to her revenge quest
- Her visions are just nightmares from trauma

## What Hesterian Doesn't Know:

- **Identity Change:** [[Korfel Withrethin]] now goes by "Babenon Dosal" and "The Gentleman"
- **Criminal Rise:** He's become a major Myriad boss with significant power
- **Stone of Memory:** Her visions come from a [[stone-of-memory]] she unknowingly carries
- **Family Tragedy:** [[The Capture of Melthes|Her brother Melthes was taken by the Cerberus Assembly]]

# The Recognition Scenario

## The Moment of Truth

When Hesterian finally encounters "The Gentleman" during Myriad business, both will recognize each other immediately. This creates explosive dramatic tension:

**Hesterian's Perspective:**

- Shock: "You're supposed to be Korfel Withrethin, not some crime boss"
- Rage: "You killed me and built an empire while an innocent man rots in prison"
- Tactical Assessment: "He has resources, guards, and I'm outnumbered"

**Korfel's Perspective:**

- Terror: "She should be dead - how is she here?"
- Calculation: "What does she know? Who has she told?"
- Damage Control: "Can I eliminate this threat without exposing myself?"

## Immediate Complications

**No Simple Infiltration:** Traditional spy work becomes impossible when the target knows exactly who you are and what you want.

**Mutual Leverage:** Both have devastating information about the other, creating a complex power dynamic rather than one-sided revenge.

**Witness Management:** Any confrontation happens in front of Korfel's people, who don't know his real identity.

**Blood Sample Protocol:** [[Blood Sample Collection Protocol]] becomes a critical tactical element - Korfel will desperately want Hesterian's blood for tracking.

# Character Development Opportunities

## Core Moral Questions

**Justice vs. Revenge:** Does exposing [[Rylan Estevez Frame Job|Rylan's wrongful imprisonment]] matter more than personal satisfaction?

**Greater Good vs. Personal Vendetta:** Taking down The Gentleman might destabilize [[Zadash]]'s criminal balance - is that worth it?

**Party Loyalty vs. Individual Goals:** How far will Hesterian go before her quest endangers her companions?

**Means vs. Ends:** What criminal acts is she willing to commit to achieve her goals?

## Character Growth Arcs

**From Victim to Agent:** Moving from reactive revenge-seeking to proactive justice-building

**Understanding Power:** Learning how institutional change works vs. individual satisfaction

**Family Connections:** Discovery of [[The Capture of Melthes|Melthes's fate]] adds stakes beyond personal revenge

**Identity Integration:** Accepting her nature as a [[Hollow One]] while pursuing human goals

# Plot Development Stages

## Phase 1: The Approach (Current)

- [ ] **Trigger Opportunity:** Party travels to [[Zadash]] region or encounters Myriad operatives
- [ ] Initial contact with Myriad representatives
- [ ] Learning about "The Gentleman" without knowing his identity
- [ ] **Choice Point:** Commit to infiltration or find another approach

## Phase 2: First Contact

- [ ] Meeting with The Gentleman for "business"
- [ ] **Recognition Moment:** Both realize who the other is
- [ ] **Critical Choice:** Immediate confrontation vs. strategic patience
- [ ] **Blood Sample Demand:** Korfel insists on [[Blood Sample Collection Protocol]]
- [ ] **Information Warfare:** Both sides probe what the other knows

## Phase 3: Complex Negotiation

- [ ] Neither can simply eliminate the other without consequences
- [ ] **Possible Alliance:** Temporary cooperation while planning betrayal
- [ ] **Escalation Options:** How far each side pushes before open warfare
- [ ] **Party Integration:** How Hesterian's quest affects group dynamics
- [ ] **Evidence Gathering:** Building case against Korfel while avoiding exposure

## Phase 4: Resolution Paths

Multiple potential endings based on player choices:

### Resolution Path A: Justice Through Law

- Expose Korfel's crimes and true identity to authorities
- Free [[Rylan Estevez]] from wrongful imprisonment
- Risk destabilizing criminal balance in [[Zadash]]

### Resolution Path B: Criminal Justice

- Use Myriad position to destroy organization from within
- Turn [[Cree Deeproots]] against Korfel through [[The Capture of Melthes|Assembly connection]]
- Replace criminal empire with more ethical alternative

### Resolution Path C: Personal Revenge

- Direct confrontation and elimination of Korfel
- Accept collateral damage to criminal underworld
- Focus on personal satisfaction over systematic change

### Resolution Path D: Uneasy Alliance

- Leverage mutual knowledge for ongoing cooperation
- Use Korfel's resources for larger campaign goals
- Accept moral compromise for strategic advantage

# Hidden Information

> [!secret]- DM Only
> 
> ## Recognition Scene Management:
> 
> **Setup Requirements:**
> 
> - Korfel should be in position of apparent power (his territory, his people)
> - Other party members present but not understanding full context
> - Business pretense gives both characters reason to maintain facades initially
> - Blood sample collection provides immediate tactical flashpoint
> 
> **Dialogue Hooks:**
> 
> - Korfel: "Do I... know you from somewhere?"
> - Hesterian: "You look familiar. Didn't you used to live in Port Damali?"
> - Korfel: "I'm afraid you're mistaken. I've always been a Zadash man."
> - Hesterian: "Funny. I could have sworn I knew a Korfel Withrethin once."
> 
> **Escalation Triggers:**
> 
> - Direct use of Korfel's real name
> - Reference to Port Damali murders
> - Mention of [[Rylan Estevez]]
> - Refusal to provide blood sample
> - Threatening gestures from either side
> 
> ## Korfel's Strategic Responses:
> 
> **Immediate Tactics:** Reference [[Korfel Withrethin]] NPC page for detailed reactions **Long-term Plans:** Leverage [[The Gentleman's Criminal Empire]] resources **Vulnerabilities:** [[Rylan Estevez Frame Job]] exposure risk **Key Personnel:** [[Cree Deeproots]] becomes critical for surveillance
> 
> ## Campaign Integration Points:
> 
> **Melthes Connection:** If Hesterian mentions her brother, creates opportunity for [[Cree Deeproots]] recruitment **Assembly Opposition:** Common enemy provides potential alliance opportunity **Zadash Politics:** Resolution affects broader criminal/political landscape **Justice Subplot:** [[Rylan Estevez]] wrongful imprisonment becomes separate quest line
