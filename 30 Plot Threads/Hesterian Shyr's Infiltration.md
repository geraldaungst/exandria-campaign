# Overview

Hesterian has expressed the goal of infiltrating the Myriad criminal organization. Unknown to her, this quest will lead her directly to the man who murdered her - [[Korfel Withrethin]], who now operates as "The Gentleman" (Babenon Dosal), a major Myriad boss in [[Zadash]].

# Current State

## Recent Events

- Hesterian visited [[Harmony Hall]] and confronted [[Grisul Adder]]
- Learned some details about events after her murder
- Established that she's seeking her killer and has leads pointing north

## Active Elements

- Player has expressed interest in Myriad infiltration
- Hesterian knows her killer fled north, possibly to [[Zadash]]
- Geographic progression brings party closer to Zadash/northern regions
- Potential connection to [[Eidechse (Amanda Jeane)|Dechs]]'s herb delivery mission

## Blocking Issues

- No immediate catalyst for beginning infiltration
- Party currently focused on other objectives
- Hesterian hasn't connected Myriad infiltration to revenge quest yet

# Player Knowledge

## What Hesterian Knows:

- **The Setup:** Her lover betrayed their escape plan to secure Korfel's patronage
- **Current Lead:** Killer fled north, possibly to [[Zadash]]
- **Infiltration Goal:** Wants to infiltrate the Myriad (player choice)
- **Mysterious Visions:** [[Hesterian Shyr (Dot)#Mysterious Secret|Strange dreams about "Scourger" and flames]]

## What Hesterian Thinks She Knows:

- Korfel is probably still using his original name
- Her infiltration of the Myriad is unrelated to her revenge quest

- **Criminal Rise:** He's become a major Myriad boss in [[Zadash]]
- **Stone of Memory:** Her visions come from a [[stone-of-memory]] she unknowingly carries
- **Cerberus Assembly Connection:** The stone contains memories from a Volstrucker agent
- **Family Tragedy:** [[The Capture of Melthes|Her brother Melthes was taken by the Cerberus Assembly]]

# Plot Hierarchy

## Long-term Plans

### Character Arc Integration

From [[05 General Plans/20 Character Story Beats#Short Term]]:

> [[Hesterian Shyr (Dot)|Hesterian]] will infiltrate the Myriad, but doing so will compel her to commit evil acts.

### Multiple Resolution Paths

- **Revenge Path:** Direct confrontation with Korfel/The Gentleman
- **Justice Path:** Expose his crimes through legal/official channels

- **Redemption Path:** Confront past while helping others escape similar situations

### Connected Revelations

- **Melthes Revelation:** Learning about Cerberus Assembly taking her brother
- **Political Implications:** Assembly connections create larger stakes
