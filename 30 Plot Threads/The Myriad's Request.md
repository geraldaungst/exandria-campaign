# Scenario

*   **The Herbs:** The rare and valuable herbs are highly sought after by various factions in Zadash.

*   **The Independent Buyer:** An independent buyer, perhaps a merchant or a collector of rare ingredients, hired Dechs *before* she joined the party to acquire the herbs from a source outside of Zadash. The merchant is primarily motivated by profit and is largely indifferent to the intended use of the herbs. He initially intended to sell the herbs to The Gentleman, but the Riverbend Mercantile offered a higher price, so he switched his allegiance. He is unaware (or unconcerned) about the rivalry between The Gentleman and the Riverbend Mercantile.

*   **The Riverbend Mercantile:** A seemingly legitimate merchant guild specializing in food products, particularly goods transported along the Eisfus River. They use their trade routes and established infrastructure to discreetly smuggle illicit substances, including rare herbs. They intend to use the herbs for their own illicit purposes, whatever those may be.

*   **Dechs:** Currently traveling with the party, Dechs is carrying the herbs, completely unaware of the illegal operations and the conflict brewing in Zadash. She knows she is supposed to deliver them to the independent buyer, who will then sell them to the Riverbend Mercantile. She trusts the independent buyer and believes she is simply fulfilling a legitimate contract.

*   **The Gentleman (Korfel Withrethin):** The Gentleman, secretly Korfel Withrethin, also wants the herbs. He initially expected to acquire them from the independent buyer, but was outbid by the Riverbend Mercantile. Enraged by this betrayal and determined to acquire the herbs, he decides to frame the Riverbend Mercantile and use the party to do his dirty work.

*   **The Gentleman's Task (Revised):** After the party arrives in Zadash, The Gentleman approaches them with a task. He explains that he has received credible information that the Riverbend Mercantile is planning to smuggle a dangerous and illegal substance into the city disguised as a shipment of rare herbs. He needs the party to investigate the Riverbend Mercantile's operations, identify the shipment, and prevent it from entering Zadash. He emphasizes the importance of discretion and avoiding unnecessary bloodshed, as the Riverbend Mercantile is a powerful and well-connected organization. He might subtly hint that this illegal substance is particularly harmful and could have devastating consequences for the city. He might also mention that he had been negotiating with a merchant for a shipment of rare herbs, only to have the deal fall through at the last minute due to the Riverbend Mercantile's interference.

*   **The Party's Investigation:** As the party investigates the Riverbend Mercantile, they might:
    *   Discover Dechs' Connection: They might uncover Dechs' connection to the independent buyer and her plan to deliver the herbs to the Riverbend Mercantile. This could happen through Dechs confiding in the party, or through the party overhearing a conversation or finding a clue.
    *   Find Evidence of Illicit Activities: They might find evidence of the Riverbend Mercantile's involvement in smuggling other illegal substances, further fueling The Gentleman's claims. However, this evidence might be circumstantial or planted by The Gentleman.
    *   Be Approached by the Independent Buyer: The independent buyer might approach the party, seeking to ensure that Dechs fulfills her contract and delivers the herbs to the Riverbend Mercantile. He might be nervous and evasive, hinting that something is not right.

*   **Possible Twists:**
    *   **The Gentleman is manipulating the party:** He knows Dechs has the herbs and is trying to use the party to steal them from her without revealing his true intentions.
    *   **The Riverbend Mercantile is innocent (of this particular crime):** They are being framed by The Gentleman, who wants to eliminate them as a competitor. They might be involved in other illegal activities, but they are not planning to smuggle anything dangerous into the city at this time.
    *   **The herbs are not dangerous:** The Gentleman is lying about the herbs being dangerous to manipulate the party. He simply wants them for his own purposes.
    *   **Dechs is unknowingly carrying something else:** The independent buyer might have secretly added something else to the shipment, something that is truly dangerous and that the Riverbend Mercantile is unaware of.
    *   **The herbs are cursed:** The herbs have a dark secret or a dangerous side effect that everyone is trying to conceal.
    *   **The herbs are a key ingredient:** The herbs are a key ingredient in a ritual or potion that The Gentleman needs to complete a
