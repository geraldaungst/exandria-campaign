# Overview
- The Savalirwood was originally called the Veluthil Forest - a pristine elven forest in Northern Wildemount
- The corruption spread from Molaesmyr's center in 585 PD, gradually transforming the forest into the cursed Savalirwood

## Key effects of the corruption:
- Dense, sickly purple fog permeates the forest
- Plant life becomes twisted and aggressive
- Native creatures are warped into more dangerous versions
- The forest actively resists attempts at settlement or clearing

## Current state of the Forest:
- Covers much of Northern Wynandir
- Surrounds the ruins of Molaesmyr, making them nearly inaccessible
- Creates a natural barrier between Uthodurn and the rest of Wildemount
- Home to dangerous mutated creatures and cursed fey

### Harmonic rifts throughout the forest:
- Connect to the Feywild and occasionally other planes
- Allow corrupted creatures to enter
- Growing larger and more frequent over time

# Current State of the Plot
- Despite attempts by Uthodurn's mages and others, no cure for the corruption has been found in over 250 years

# Player Knowledge
- What they know: [[Seraphina Amaris (Vicki)|Seraphina]] knows that corruption was spreading when she left and that she has traveled 300 years into the future.
- What they think they know:
- What they don't know:
