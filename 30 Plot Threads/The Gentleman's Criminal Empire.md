# Core Information

## The Gentleman's Criminal Empire

### **Rise to Power**

After fleeing [[Port Damali]] following [[The Port Damali Murders]], [[Korfel Withrethin]] arrived in [[Zadash]] with murder proceeds and criminal connections. Using his merchant background and ruthless pragmatism, he systematically built a criminal power base:

**Initial Strategy (Year 1):**

- Established legitimate merchant front operations
- Cultivated relationships with corrupt officials and Myriad contacts
- Used murder proceeds as seed money for bribes and operations
- Adopted the identity "Babenon Dosal" for trusted associates

**Expansion Phase (Years 2-3):**

- Became known as "The Gentleman" in criminal circles
- Established headquarters beneath the Evening Nip tavern
- Built network through combination of bribery, blackmail, and strategic elimination
- Recruited specialists like [[Cree Deeproots]] for blood magic surveillance

### **Current Criminal Operations**

**Base of Operations:** Evening Nip tavern in [[Zadash]], with extensive underground network  
**Territory:** Significant influence over Zadash's underworld and portions of legitimate commerce  
**Operating Style:** Sophisticated criminal enterprise with veneer of respectability

**Key Operations:**

- **Smuggling Networks:** Control of underground tunnels and forgotten passages beneath Zadash
- **Protection Rackets:** "Insurance" for businesses against other criminal elements
- **Information Brokerage:** Extensive spy network throughout the city
- **Black Market Trading:** Rare artifacts, stolen goods, contraband substances
- **Political Corruption:** Bribed officials in tax offices, judiciary, and lower Righteous Brand ranks

### **Resources and Assets**
