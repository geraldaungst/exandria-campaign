# Overview

Qilynn knows her final mission failure wasn't her fault and suspects sabotage, but lacks proof. The truth involves a complex web of grudges, unrequited love, and manipulation within the Clasp that she has yet to uncover.

# Current State

## Recent Events

- Qilynn continues to carry suspicions about her failed heist
- She remains unaware of the true perpetrators
- [[Eledyr Dephar]] is now working with the [[Emissaries of the Sunfall]], giving him new resources

## Active Elements

- **Evidence gathered:** Qilynn has Yrene's testimony and physical evidence (handwriting samples)
- **Alliance formed:** Qilynn and Yrene are actively working together to expose Eledyr
- **Investigation constraint:** Qilynn promised not to kill Eledyr (creates interesting tension)
- **Eledyr's escalation:** He's asking questions about the prophecy, making him more dangerous
- **Current separation:** Geographic distance from Port Damali limits immediate action

## Blocking Issues

- **Geographic separation:** Party is far from Port Damali where evidence and targets are located
- **Promise constraint:** Qilynn's agreement not to kill Eledyr limits resolution options
- **Insufficient proof:** While evidence exists, it may not be enough to convince Aelorin
- **Eledyr's new resources:** His Emissary connections give him protection and power
- **Timing pressure:** Eledyr's prophecy research suggests he's working on something time-sensitive

# Player Knowledge

## What Qilynn Knows:

### About Her Failed Mission:

![[Qilynn's Final Mission#Core Information]]

![[Aelorin's Reaction#Core Information]]

### About Her Suspicions:

![[A Suspect for Qilynn#Core Information]]

### Direct Intelligence from Yrene (Sessions 7 & 8):

- **Eledyr's Identity:** She worked with Eledyr before - he was "one of the other trainees under Aelorin"
- **Direct Accusation:** Yrene told her "Eledyr was the one who framed Q"
- **Physical Evidence:** Yrene found "disguised notes in Eledyr's handwriting detailing changes in the artifact's location and additional security measures"
- **Operational Evidence:** Guard shifts were changed last minute, unfamiliar faces appeared during the heist
- **Current Activity:** Eledyr "has been asking too many questions about the prophecy"
- **Alliance Status:** Yrene is actively "trying to clear Q's name" and they agreed to work together
- **Constraint:** Qilynn promised Yrene she wouldn't kill Eledyr

## What Qilynn Thinks She Knows:

- Eledyr deliberately sabotaged her mission (Yrene's accusation + evidence)
- Yrene was wrongly suspected and is actually trying to help
- There's enough evidence to potentially expose Eledyr
- The sabotage connects to current prophecy research

## What Qilynn Doesn't Know:

![[The Truth about Eledyr#Core Information]]

### Additional Unknowns:

- **The petty motivation:** Eledyr's grudge stems from her casual training feedback
- **Yrene's true feelings:** Yrene's protective actions come from romantic feelings Qilynn never suspected
- **Eledyr's current allegiances:** He's now working with the Emissaries of the Sunfall
- **Scale of deception:** How deeply Eledyr has infiltrated and manipulated Clasp operations

# Long-term Plans

## Character Arc Integration

From [[05 General Plans/20 Character Story Beats#Medium Term]]:

> [[Qilynn Duskwhisper (Nicole)|Qilynn]] wants to prove that she's actually a damn good thief. She specifically wants to prove herself to [[Aelorin Nightshade|Aelorin]] - both to show him up and to be accepted by him. Once she does this, [[Aelorin Nightshade|Aelorin]] will reconsider and could potentially become an ally for the party.

## Possible Branches

- **Revenge Path:** Qilynn seeks to destroy Eledyr, potentially making enemy of Clasp
- **Justice Path:** Qilynn exposes Eledyr to [[Aelorin Nightshade]], earning respect
- **Redemption Path:** Qilynn helps Eledyr overcome his petty grudges
- **Practical Path:** Qilynn uses knowledge as leverage for party goals

## NPCs

- [[Eledyr Dephar]] - The actual saboteur, now Emissary agent
