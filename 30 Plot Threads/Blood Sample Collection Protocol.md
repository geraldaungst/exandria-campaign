# Core Information

## Blood Sample Collection Protocol

### **The Procedure**

**Administering Agent:** [[Cree Deeproots]], a tabaxi Blood Domain cleric employed by [[Korfel Withrethin]] (The Gentleman)  
**Timing:** Required from all new associates, allies, or persons conducting business with The Gentleman  
**Method:** Ceremonial collection using small vials, presented as "standard insurance policy"

**How it's presented to targets:**

- Framed as mutual trust-building exercise
- "Standard business practice" for high-value partnerships
- Emphasis on reciprocal nature ("I provide samples too")
- Presented with formal, almost ritual-like solemnity to add legitimacy

### **Mechanical Capabilities**

Based on Blood Domain cleric abilities, the collected samples enable:

**Crimson Bond (Primary Use):**

- **Range:** 10 miles from the blood sample
- **Information Gained:** Approximate distance and direction to the person
- **Health Status:** General state of health (percentage of hit points)
- **Duration:** Can maintain concentration for up to one hour
- **Active Monitoring:** Requires conscious effort and action to activate

**Enhanced Surveillance (Advanced Use):**

- **Forced Saves:** Can force Constitution saving throws on the target
- **Sensory Hijacking:** If target fails save, can see through their eyes or hear through their ears
- **Duration:** Number of rounds equal to Cree's Wisdom modifier
- **Cost:** Cree takes necrotic damage regardless of outcome

### **Storage and Organization**

**Physical Storage:** Small leather satchel containing labeled vials  
**Documentation:** Detailed records of whose blood corresponds to which sample  
**Security:** Kept in The Gentleman's secure areas, accessible only to trusted inner circle  
**Maintenance:** Samples remain viable indefinitely once properly preserved

### **Strategic Applications**

**Tracking Purposes:**

- Monitor associates for potential betrayal or flight
- Locate individuals who have valuable information or assets
- Verify claimed locations during negotiations
- Track enemies or rivals within the organization

**Control and Intimidation:**

- Psychological pressure - targets know they can be watched
- Demonstration of magical capabilities and resources
- Insurance against betrayal or double-crossing
- Leverage in negotiations and power dynamics

**Intelligence Gathering:**

- Monitor health status to assess threats or vulnerabilities
- Gain sensory access during key meetings or events
- Track movement patterns and associate networks
- Verify truthfulness through proximity to claimed locations

### **Presentation and Justification**

**To New Associates:** "A time-honored tradition ensuring mutual trust and protection"  
**Business Rationale:** "Given the dangerous nature of our enterprises, knowing the safety of our partners is essential"  
**Reciprocal Assurance:** "I maintain samples from all my trusted associates, including myself"  
**Professional Image:** "This level of care and preparation separates us from common criminals"

### **Operational Limitations**

**Range Restriction:** Only effective within 10 miles  
**Resource Cost:** Requires Cree's active participation and spell slots  
**Concentration Dependent:** Tracking requires sustained focus, limiting multitasking  
**Physical Vulnerability:** Samples can be destroyed, stolen, or corrupted  
**Personnel Dependency:** System fails if Cree is unavailable, dead, or disloyal

### **Counter-Measures (Unknown to Targets)**

**Detection Avoidance:** Most targets unaware when being monitored  
**Magic Resistance:** Some individuals may have natural or magical resistance  
**False Information:** Samples only show location/health, not activities or intentions  
**Timing Gaps:** Monitoring is not constant, creating windows of unobserved activity

### **Security Implications**

**For The Gentleman:**

- Provides early warning of betrayal or law enforcement action
- Enables rapid location of valuable assets or information
- Creates psychological deterrent against double-crossing
- Demonstrates sophisticated capabilities to intimidate rivals

**For Targets:**

- Constant potential surveillance creates ongoing stress
- Limits freedom of movement and association
- Provides leverage for The Gentleman in all negotiations
- Makes escape or betrayal significantly more difficult
