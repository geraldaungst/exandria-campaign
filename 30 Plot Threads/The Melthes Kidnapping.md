**Location:** Cerberus Assembly research facility in [[Rexxentrum]]  
**Cree's Role:** Conducted magical assessment of new "acquisition"

**What Happened:**

- Two Volstrucker agents brought in a 16-year-old half-elf named [[Melthes]] from Xarzith Kitril
- Cree was assigned to use her blood magic abilities to evaluate his magical potential
- **Assessment Results:** Confirmed his unique Feywild/Feydark connection abilities
- **Emotional Observation:** Subject was terrified, kept asking about his family and when he could go home
- **Professional Notes:** Recommended for advanced study under Evelia Fenzana's research division

**What Cree Remembers:**

- **Name:** "Melthes" - unusual enough to stick in her memory
- **Appearance:** Young half-elf, obviously frightened and displaced
- **Abilities:** Distinctive Feywild magical resonance, unlike typical magic users

    **Personal Security:** Maintains low profile, uses organization resources for protection  
    **Counter-Intelligence:** Aware of basic operational security but not full organizational secrets  
    **Escape Plans:** Professional criminal with contingency plans, but currently committed to position
