## Plot
Select from:
- Master Plot
- Henchmen

- 121

# Act I
Description: What do we expect, and how is this different?
## Intro Goal
Players will either seek out or run into [[Aethor Kalisk]] during their travels. They will learn that Aethor is seeking a powerful artifact and has a lead on that artifact.

## Intro Enemy
Calderax doesn't actually have the shard: [[Letter to Calderax]]. 

## Intro Situation
Calderax requires Aethor to go find an item of personal value.

# Act II
## Set Up Journey
The party must travel to Othemoor Marsh and locate the cluster of willow trees mentioned in the letter. 

Approaching the Othemoor
> As your path winds through the last of the open, rolling hills, the landscape ahead shifts dramatically. The vibrant greens of the hills fade into a dense wall of dark, gnarled gray-green trees shrouded in a thin, hazy mist. The air grows heavier, thick with humidity and the stench of stagnant water. Fat drops of rain begin to fall—warm and relentless, but offering no comfort from the rising heat.
> 
> In the distance, the sprawling expanse of the Othemoor spreads out like a bruise on the land, a marshland teeming with shadowy growth and strange, twisting branches. There’s an oppressive silence here, broken only by the occasional croak of unseen creatures and the distant splatter of rain hitting soggy, soaked earth. 

Entering the Swamp
> As your boots sink into the mud with a wet squelch, the road behind disappears, swallowed by the oppressive gloom of the swamp. The ground shifts beneath you, unstable and treacherous, each step threatening to pull you deeper into the mire. The air is suffocatingly thick, and the persistent light rain only worsens the sensation, dripping down your face like sweat and clinging to your skin. Strange shapes shift in the distance, just at the edge of your vision, and the faint sounds of water lapping and creatures stirring beneath the surface remind you of the secrets long buried in the Othemoor’s depths.

## First Attempt & Obstacle
The party find the cluster of trees and some bits of a backpack, but no compass. There is a trail of thin, glassy shards that leads off further into the swamp.

# Act III
## Final Showdown
Party can track the creature easily and are able to locate a [[flail-snail-mpmm|Flail Snail]] which is currently being attacked by a [[nergaliid-egw|Nergaliid]]. If they defeat both creatures and dissect the snail, they will find the compass was ingested by the creature.

Anyone proficient in Nature would know these creatures are not native to the area. An Arcana check (DC 15) would reveal that the Flail Snail is some sort of elemental creature and the Devil Toad is a fiend that is very much out of place here.

# Rewards
If they return the compass to Calderax, he will tell them about [[Keldar Stonefoot]] and send them to deliver the compass themselves.
