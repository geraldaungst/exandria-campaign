- [ ]  Review notes from last session

# Strong Start
- Characters are all on a skyship from Emon to [[Port Damali]]. Each one has a [[20 Character Story Beats#Backstory|reason to be going]] but they don't necessarily know each other. All are from somewhere in Wildemount.
- Ship captain: [[Captain Thyakas]]
- Others on the ship (checked are built in Roll20):
	- [x] [[Georgina Wiseacre]] - Heading home to support her war-ravaged home.
	- [x]  [[Kite of the Wind]] - "Happy to make your acquaintance, happy to party with you, but we are not friends, and my business is none of yours." If pressed, says he is from [[Zadash]] and just heading home after a long, tedious, and unsuccessful journey.
	- [x]  [[Berinon Truegust]] (first officer, part of the skyjacking)
	- [x]  [[Guzezzik]] (ship's cook, bribed to poison the captain)
	- [x]  [[Aethor Kalisk]] (passenger, en route to PD to seek an artifact, skyjacking is intended to divert him or kill him without it being known he was a direct target) - Not as quiet about his business as he should be--he is excited about his journey and about what he is seeking, though he won't say much in detail about exactly what it is. "My boss wouldn't want me to say any more. Academic rivalries being what they are. I'm sure you know."
	- [x]  [[Radelia Caphax]] (passenger, spying on [[Aethor Kalisk|Aethor]], not aware of the skyjacking plot) - Ostensibly returning to Wildemount after being in Whitestone selling textiles for her company Cithrel Textiles.
	- [x]  [[Orlan Iotha]] (ship's quartermaster)
	- [x]  [[Eston Ralnora]] (ship's bursar)
	- [x]  [[Brelia Solvorn]] (ship's medic and navigator)
	- [x] [[Grendar Goss]] (ship's bartender)
	- [x]  [[Durnvolk Durmir]] (passenger, heading to PD to assist with construction of a new forge temple of Moradin there)
	- [x] [[Tharivol]] and [[Sariel]]
- Depending on how things progress, the ship may make it to [[Xorhas Landing|Xorhas]], land safely in [[Port Damali|Port Damali]], or crash somewhere in the [[Crash in Dwendalian Empire|Dwendalian Empire]] or in the [[Cyrios Mountains Crash|Cyrios Mountains]].

# Scenes
## Routine Travel
We can RP interactions with other party members, passengers, and crew as long as the party wants. There are four days of uneventful travel over the ocean.
- Characters met on day 1. They headed to the lounge/bar and met Grendar, Captain Thyakas, Durnvolk, and Georgina. (Kite made a comment from the other side of the bar about "no bagpipes".)
- [[Hesterian Shyr (Dot)|Hesterian]] got the bartender to agree to let her do a show that evening.
- [[Hesterian Shyr (Dot)|Hesterian]] does her "second show" and gets lots of attention from the crowd.
- Georgina Wiseacre told Laucian to meet her at the Staff and Scimitar tavern.
## The Hijacking Begins
- At dawn on the fifth day, the coastline of Wildemount appears as a faint line on the water.
- Soon after sunrise, before many are awake, two of the passengers, [[Georgina Wiseacre]] and [[Kite of the Wind]] and two crew members ([[Berinon Truegust]] and [[Guzezzik]]) launch an effort to hijack the ship and redirect it to Xorhas.
- [x] First, the captain will fall ill and be confined to her cabin along with the medic, [[Brelia Solvorn]], who will attempt (unsuccessfully) to treat [[Captain Thyakas|Thyakas]].
	- [x] If the party does nothing directly, both will later be found dead of poisoning in their quarters.
- [x] [[Berinon Truegust|Berinon]] will take over navigation, subtly redirecting the path towards Xorhas.
	- [x] Players with proficiency in Nature or Surival or with navigation tools can make a skill check (DC 17) to notice that the ship is headed in the wrong direction.
	- [x] Hijackers will lock the bridge and set up a *[[glyph-of-warding|Glyph of Warding]]* that will cast *[[z_compendium/spells/thunderwave|Thunderwave]]* if someone tries to open or unlock the door. Finding the glyph requires a DC 17 Intelligence ([[skills#Investigation|Investigation]]) check, and disarming the trap is only possible with *[[dispel-magic|Dispel Magic]]*. Unlocking the door requires a DC 18 lockpicking check.
	- [ ] They will also lock the engine room and protect it with a Glyph of Warding. If anyone steps into the room outside the engine room, a *Darkness* spell will be cast centered on the engine room door, making it much more difficult to open the lock. This lock also requires a DC 18 lockpicking check, but in darkness the check is at disadvantage.
	- [ ] Soon after the captain falls ill, several rumors will begin to circulate among the passengers and crew:
		- [ ] The captain caught some kind of disease that is now spreading among all the passengers.
		- [ ] The captain's lover picked it up while on leave
		- [ ] I heard there was a contraband monkey loose on the ship on the last trip--it must have come from that
		- [ ] The bartender keeps bringing these exotic plants on board, it was probably something he gave the captain
		- [ ] This sounds just like that curse I heard about that the Kryn were creating to destroy the Empire
		- [ ] No it was definitely the Cerberus Assembly that was manufacturing it to take out the "kricks"
		- [ ] I bet it's Mind Flayers...it's always Mind Flayers.
		- [x] There's a gigantic storm brewing near [[Port Damali]] and we have to go around it.
		- [ ] The engine has malfunctioned and we are going to crash! I heard there were stowaways on the last trip who sabotaged the ship.
	- [ ] The growing rumors will cause the crew to do two things:
		- [ ] Passengers will be restricted to quarters except for meals
		- [ ] Everyone will be asked to watch for signs of odd behavior among the other passengers
		- [ ] Passenger belongings will be searched for contraband
		- [ ] When [[Qilynn Duskwhisper (Nicole)|Qilynn]]'s belongings are searched, an empty vial of poison and a coded letter will be retrieved. The letter will later be found to have instructions from the Clasp to kill Thyakas and take the ship to Ank'Harel.
- Once discovered, the hijackers will kill crew and innocents without hesitation.
## Complications
### 1 - Hijack Successful
- If the hijackers are successful in subduing the crew and passengers quickly, a reckless passenger will attempt to gain control of the ship (assuming the PCs do not try to do so themselves). The attempt may result in the ship losing control and beginning to crash.
### 2 - PCs Take Control
- PCs might try to take control of the ship. They will have to defeat [[Berinon Truegust|Berinon]] who has taken over piloting and then figure out how to fly the ship themselves.
	- Flying the ship requires a successful DC 18 Investigation check (at disadvantage) followed by a straight DC 12 Dexterity check.
	- If the player has proficiency with water vehicles, the Investigation check is a straight roll. Only another player with water vehicle proficiency can help with this check to make it at advantage.
	- It is not possible for anyone to help with the ship piloting. If a different person attempts to pilot than the one who figured out how to fly it, the Dexterity check is at disadvantage. No proficiencies will help this since it is raw reaction.
#### 2.1 - Trying to Navigate
- If they manage to take control of the ship, there is still the matter of navigating. Anyone can attempt to navigate with a DC 18 Nature or Survival check at disadvantage (since it is not the usual use of those skills). A second person can assist.
	- A success means they can land the ship in [[Port Damali]] where it was originally heading, since they have charts to follow.
	- Failure means they have to find a place to land. The ship would be heading towards Xhorhas, so that is the most likely landing location, but PCs may attempt a landing elsewhere if they wish.
#### 2.2 - Loss of Control
- Loss of control means the ship will crash either in the Cyrios Mountains or somewhere in the [[Dwendalian Empire]] (choose a random location). The crash is not catastrophic since the Brumestones still work, but it is enough to damage the ship beyond easy repair. Everyone on board will take 5d6 hp of damage (rolled individually). The ship's medic and a cleric survive the crash and anyone unconscious gets d4+2 hp.
## Conclusion of the Hijacking
One way or another, the Skyship will return to Exandria at the end of this adventure. It may land successfully (either in Xorhas where the hijackers want it to land, or in [[Port Damali]] where it was intended to go originally) or it will crash (either in the [[Dwendalian Empire]] or in the Cyrios Mountains, possibly as a result of a random roll).

Depending on where they land, the characters will find things to do there to get to know each other and start developing their skills and reputation:
- [[Xorhas Landing]]
- [[Port Damali]] - Characters pursue whatever reasons they had to be in [[Port Damali]].
- [[Crash in Dwendalian Empire]] - 
- [[Cyrios Mountains Crash]] -

# Monsters
*Calculate the deadly encounter benchmark by adding together all character levels and dividing by 2 if they're 5th level or above or divide by 4 if they're 1st to 4th level. An encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than half the sum total of character levels or one quarter of character levels if the characters are 4th level or below.*
