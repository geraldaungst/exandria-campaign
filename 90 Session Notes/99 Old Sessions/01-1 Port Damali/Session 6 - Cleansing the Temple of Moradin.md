# Arrive at Plot
## Social
Party arrives early morning at the location of the [[New Temple of Moradin]]. They find Durnvolk and several other folk (dwarves, a couple of humans, a firbolg, and an elf) talking to [[Matiu]], an elder from the Ki'Nau clan that lives closest to PD. Durnvolk tells them that there will be no construction any time soon due to a conflict with the Ki'Nau. Maram is the dwarf who is most adamant that they continue.

## Combat
During their conversation, shouting breaks out between some of the dwarves and Matiu. They seem close to coming to blows. If no one intervenes, they will attack each other. The conflict is over the delays in construction.

# Journey Into Plot
## Social
Matiu removes himself from the situation and steps to the side. If any party member approaches him, he will ask for their help in mediating. "Would you explore the crypt and see what is going on?" Suggestion: The party speaks with Matiu privately, who explains the Ki'Nau's concerns about disturbing the ancient burial site. He asks them to enter the crypt respectfully and to try to calm the spirits, offering some spiritual advice or minor magical items to aid them. "We do not know the nature of this crypt or who might have been buried there. Find out and we will reward you."

## Combat
Players encounter the brazier puzzle in the first room.

# Discover Not Plot
## Social
Players first find the murals which depict the trial and execution of the criminals:
> A long bench is built into an alcove to the left. Across from it, you see a large, faded mural with three panels depicting scenes from Ki'Nau life.

With a DC 10 History or Religion check, the player realizes this is intended as an area of meditation and contemplation. On a roll of 15 or higher, they also know that this is common in Ki'Nau tombs and the murals typically honor and celebrate the deceased.

### Tribunal of Shadows
> "As you examine the first mural, you see a grand courtroom where the accused stand in chains before grim-faced judges. Shadows swirl ominously in the background, and ghostly figures of victims hover above, their expressions filled with sorrow and accusation."
### The Tides of Judgment
> "The central panel reveals a somber scene. Four condemned criminals are bound and tied to rocks along the shoreline. Their faces show fear and resignation. Ghostly spirits of their victims hover above, watching the ritual with an air of expectation and solemnity. The peaceful village in the background contrasts sharply with the turbulent sea, emphasizing the gravity of the ritual."

A DC 10 Investigation or History check makes it clear that this scene depicts some sort of drowning ritual since there is a high-tide water mark clearly visible above where the criminals lie.

### The Satisfaction of Justice
> "The final mural depicts the aftermath of the executions. The spirits of the victims, once filled with sorrow and accusation, now appear serene and satisfied. Their ethereal forms rise towards the sky, freed from their earthly grievances. Below, the spectral guardians stand vigil, their expressions resolute. A solemn entity looms above, embodying the justice delivered. Swirling, tranquil energies fill the background, symbolizing the restored balance and peace."

## Combat
Players encounter four Shadows that they must defeat through combat or some other means.

# Journey to New Plot
## Social
Players who search the area (DC 15 Investigation check) locate the [[Journal of Solan Taku]] and an obsidian warhammer that collectively point to the innocence of the executed. They also see a faint yellow light appear further down the tunnel.


## Combat
They discover a small rift has appeared inside a collapsed section of the floor. A monster from the Feywild leaps through the rift and attacks the party.

# Kill Plot and Win
## Social
The party bring the evidence back to the Ki'Nau elder who is stunned by the discovery. They must help him convince the dwarves to accommodate the requests of the Ki'Nau.

If they bring back the warhammer, it will turn out to be Grovelthrash, one of the Arms of the Betrayer.
