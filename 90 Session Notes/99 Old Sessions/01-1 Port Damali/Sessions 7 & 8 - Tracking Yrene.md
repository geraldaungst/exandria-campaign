[[Yrene Shadowthorn|Yrene]] is found in a dark corner at the back of the [[Gilded Pearl Tavern]]. She seems to be in a tense conversation with a nervous-looking informant.

If players attempt to eavesdrop, they may hear:

1. **Ambiguous Statements:**
	- "We need to make sure no one else finds out about this [[01 The Prophecy|prophecy]]. It could shift the power balance drastically."
	- "It's vital that we act quickly and decisively. We can't afford any more failures."
	- "The information I've gathered must not fall into the wrong hands."
	- "Our position within the Clasp depends on how we handle this situation."
	- "Anyone who stands in our way must be dealt with, no matter the cost."
	- "I heard there was a passenger on that skyship that just arrived who might know something."
1. **Clues Suggesting Yrene’s True Intentions:**
	- "Eledyr has been asking too many questions about the [[01 The Prophecy|prophecy]]. We need to watch him closely."
	- "He’s dangerous and unpredictable. If he learns the full extent of the [[01 The Prophecy|prophecy]], he could use it to undermine us."
	- "I suspect Eledyr was behind Qilynn’s setup. His actions have been too coincidental."
	- "We need evidence to expose Eledyr’s betrayal and clear Qilynn’s name."
	- "[[Aelorin Nightshade|Aelorin]] has a another new mentee and Eledyr's not very happy about it."

## First Meeting in the Tavern
Yrene shared that Eledyr was the one who framed Q and seemed to be telling the truth.

Eledyr was one of the other trainees under [[Aelorin Nightshade|Aelorin]]. Q did a job with him once. Y is trying to clear Q’s name. Y agreed to meet with Q to discuss further and plan, but Q had to agree not to kill Eledyr.

The big guy with Y remains unnamed.

### Things Yrene remembers about Calderax
- [x] **Distraction Role**: Calderax's assignment was to create a distraction at a nearby location to draw guards away from the heist site. His distraction worked, but due to Eledyr's interference, it didn't impact the correct guards, leading to Qilynn's capture.
- [ ] **Early Training and Ambition**: Yrene remembers Calderax as a dedicated but ambitious trainee who was always eager to prove himself. He often volunteered for difficult tasks, hoping to gain favor with [[Aelorin Nightshade|Aelorin]].
- [ ] **Personal Struggles**: Yrene knows that Calderax had a rough upbringing, similar to [[Aelorin Nightshade|Aelorin]], which made him particularly driven and loyal to those who showed him kindness. This background might make Qilynn more sympathetic towards him.

- [x] **Connection to the Obsidian Echoforge**: Yrene knows that Calderax has established connections with the Obsidian Echoforge, though she isn't aware of his current mission involving the Lorestone shard. This connection might intrigue Qilynn and raise questions about his true loyalties.
- [ ] **Unresolved Loyalty**: Yrene has heard rumors that Calderax still feels indebted to [[Aelorin Nightshade|Aelorin]] for taking him under his wing, despite any mistakes or failures. This unwavering loyalty might make Qilynn question whether Calderax could have intentionally betrayed her.
