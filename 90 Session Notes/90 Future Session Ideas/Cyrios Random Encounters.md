### Possible Dialogue

- [x] "The storms whisper of a darkness rising. A shadow that will consume all. Can't you feel it?"
- [x] "My visions showed me a broken world, a world without hope. I must find a way to prevent it, but I cannot do it alone."
- [x] "The giants believe themselves untouchable, but they are wrong. This darkness will reach even the highest peaks."
- [x] **If asked about the nature of the darkness:** "It is a hunger... a void. I see rifts tearing open the sky, and things... _things_ crawling through. They are drawn to something, some _beacon_ in the abyss." (This could relate to the line from [The Prophecy (Original Form)](obsidian://open?file=05%20General%20Plans%2FThe%20Prophecy%20\(Original%20Form\).md): "**_In the abyss, a beacon bright, its fate a mysterious stone_**")
- [ ] **If asked about the giants' role:** "The giants... they are blind. They cling to their traditions, their mountains, while the world changes around them. I see a fiery crown, a vigilant shield, and a verdant tree... symbols of power, but also of vulnerability. The giants could be any of these, or none." (This alludes to the "Three symbols" stanza in [The Prophecy (Original Form)](obsidian://open?file=05%20General%20Plans%2FThe%20Prophecy%20\(Original%20Form\).md))
- [x] **If asked about what she's doing to stop it:** "I seek knowledge. Whispers of the past, echoes of the future. I believe there are fragments... shards of something lost, scattered across the land. They hold the key, I feel it in my bones." (This connects to the [Lorestone of Eryndor](obsidian://open?file=40%20Artifacts%2FLorestone%20of%20Eryndor.md) and its shattered fragments, as described in [History of the Prophecy](obsidian://open?file=05%20General%20Plans%2FHistory%20of%20the%20Prophecy.md))
- [x] **If asked about the visions themselves:** "They come in flashes, during the storms. Images, feelings... not always clear. I see spires crumbling, groves whispering secrets. Order and chaos intertwined, a song that could be a beginning or an end." (This references the opening and later stanzas of [The Prophecy (Original Form)](obsidian://open?file=05%20General%20Plans%2FThe%20Prophecy%20\(Original%20Form\).md))
- [ ] **If asked if she knows what the party should do:** "I see paths diverging, choices to be made. A task unfolds on destiny's edge... the reforging of wisdom's key. But beware... the whispers hold a fate untold." (This alludes to the final stanza of [The Prophecy (Original Form)](obsidian://open?file=05%20General%20Plans%2FThe%20Prophecy%20\(Original%20Form\).md))
- [ ] **If asked about the beacon in the abyss:** "It pulses with a strange energy, both alluring and terrifying. It could be a source of salvation, or the herald of our doom. I sense that it is connected to the rifts, and to the things that crawl through them."
- [x] **If asked about the shattered fragments:** "They are more than just pieces of stone. They are echoes of a powerful magic, imbued with the essence of the prophecy. Finding them... piecing them together... could reveal the truth, but it could also unleash something terrible."
- [x] **A gentleman in Zadash:** "I see a city of merchants and secrets... a web of influence spun by a man of refined tastes. He seeks knowledge, but his methods are... questionable. Look for the one who offers comfort and deals in shadows."
- [ ] **A secret scholar in Rexxentrum:** "In the heart of the empire, hidden amongst towers of learning, a scholar toils in obscurity. They seek to understand the very fabric of reality, but their discoveries are dangerous. The truth is buried deep, guarded by silence and fear."
- [x] **A black dragon's hoard:** "The storms rage over a place of darkness and decay. A scaled terror sleeps upon a mountain of stolen dreams. Beware the glint of gold, for it is a lure to destruction. The hoard is not just treasure, but a prison."
- [x] **A ship called "Consecution's Hope":** "I see a vessel sailing against the tide, its name a cruel jest. It carries a burden of despair, a promise broken long ago. Follow the wake of sorrow, but be warned... some voyages lead only to oblivion."
- [ ] **An attempt to restore something that was destroyed will result in further destruction:** "The past is a dangerous thing to resurrect. Some wounds are too deep to heal. I see hands reaching to mend what is broken, but their efforts unleash a greater horror. Let the dead rest, lest they consume the living."
