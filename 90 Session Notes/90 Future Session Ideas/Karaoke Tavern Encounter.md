# D&D Karaoke Night Competition Rules

In this encounter, performers take turns singing while others in the crowd support or sabotage their efforts. Each song is its own mini-contest where everyone can participate - whether they're performing, providing backup, or working the crowd. Players contribute to the atmosphere by roleplaying their reactions in chat, with the best commentary earning inspiration dice. The encounter combines performance checks and support actions to create a social event where both natural performers and those who prefer to stay in the background can contribute meaningfully.
## Core Mechanics
### Song Selection
- Each performer chooses from available songs.
- Song order is then determined by rolling initiative.
- DM assigns Crowd Popularity modifier (-2 to +2) based on the song's local appeal.
### Lead Performance
1. Make a **Charisma (Performance)** check. *If the player actually sings along, make this check with Advantage*
2. Add the song's Crowd Popularity modifier
3. Add Support bonuses
4. Add any **Karaoke Inspiration** dice

## Support Actions
At the start of the contest, all players roll initiative again to determine order of Support Actions. The DM will make one unmodified d20 roll for the crowd's initiative. This order will remain constant through all rounds of the contest. All checks are **DC 15.**

During each performance, players can take ONE of the following actions on their turns.

Multiple characters may attempt the same support action. The first success grants the bonus described below. The second success grants only a +1 bonus (or +2 for a critical success). After two successful attempts, additional attempts at the same action with the same performer provide no benefit, regardless of success or critical success.
### Hype the Crowd
- Make a **Wisdom (Persuasion)** check
- Success: +2 to performer's result.
- Critical Success: +4 to performer and next Support Action has advantage on their check.
- Critical Failure: -1 to performer and next Support Action has disadvantage on their check.
### Add Backup Vocals
- Make a **Charisma (Performance)** check. *If player actually sings, make this check with Advantage.*
- Success: +2 to performer's result
- Critical Success: +2 to performer and the performer can reroll their Performance check if they want. The performer must use the new roll.
- Critical Failure: Your voice cracks noticeably; you have disadvantage on your next Support Action

### Dance
- Make a **Strength (Athletics)**, **Dexterity (Acrobatics)**, or **Charisma (Performance)** check
- Success: +2 to performer's result
- Critical Success: +4 to performer; choose one other player to have advantage on their next Support Action (you inspire them)
- Critical Failure: You stumble into someone; randomly chosen player has disadvantage on their next Support Action

### Sabotage, Heckle, or Distract
- Make a **Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)**, **Charisma (Intimidation)**, or **Intelligence (Investigation)** check
- Success: -2 to performer's result
- Critical Success: You were so subtle that no one suspects foul play; you have advantage on your next Sabotage attempt against any performer
- Critical Failure: Caught in the act, disadvantage on next Support Action check
- Cannot target the same performer twice
### Creative Support
- Player describes their intended action and how it supports or hinders the performer
- DM assigns appropriate skill check
- Success: +2 to performer's result (or -2 if the intent was to hinder)
- Critical Success: +4 to performer, and you gain a Karaoke Inspiration die which you may keep or give away
- Critical Failure: -1 to performer and a complication arises at DM discretion
- Each attempt at Creative Support is considered a different Support Action unless both players are doing the same thing.
- At DM discretion, success or failure may result in additional outcomes depending on the action chosen.
## Crowd Support Bonus
DM makes a single roll to simulate the cumulative effect of all NPC Support Actions. The different rolls are calculated to account for supporters of the NPC performers in the crowd.
- **4d4-4** for an NPC Performance (includes NPC supporter effect)
- **1d12 + 2d4 - 8** for a Player Character performance

## Scoring the Performance
- Base: Performance check result
- Add: Karaoke Inspiration dice used by the performer
- Add: Crowd Popularity modifier
- Add: All Support Bonuses

## Victory Conditions
Highest Performance Score at the end of the contest wins. In the event of a tie, the contest proceeds immediately to a **Sing-Off Tiebreaker**.

### Sing-Off Tiebreaker
1. Each tied performer chooses one other person to support them.
2. Roll initiative to determine order
3. Each supporter chooses *one* **Support Action** and resolves it as normal.
4. Each performer makes a Performance check (DC 16) and adds any bonuses from step 3.
5. Highest total wins. If still tied, repeat **Sing-Off** once more with disadvantage on Performance checks to represent fatigue.
### Prizes
#### First Place:
- Finely crafted lute (worth 30gp)
- Local celebrity status, which includes the winner's portrait on the wall and free drinks for a month
- Invitation to a private party hosted by a local noble
#### Second Place:
- Custom outfit from local tailor (worth 20gp)
