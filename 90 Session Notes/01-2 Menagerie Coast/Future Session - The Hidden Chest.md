> As you round a bend in the path, a massive fallen oak tree catches your attention. Its trunk, nearly four feet in diameter, lies parallel to the trail, its roots torn from the earth. But what draws your eye are two bodies sprawled beside it, their forms unnaturally still.
> The bodies - a drow in dark leather armor and a half-elf in traveler's clothes - lie on opposite sides of a wooden chest that rests in a hollow where several branches fork from the trunk. Their positions suggest they died suddenly, both slumped forward with hands outstretched. A thin dagger protrudes from beneath the face of the chest, its blade wedged into the bark of the fallen tree.
> The air here is still and heavy with the sweet-sour scent of death, though the bodies show little decay.

[[Eledyr Dephar]] and Jhularen Dyrr are the two bodies. Dyrr is dead. A player succeeding on a DC 15 medicine check will realize that Eledyr is still breathing (barely) but unstable and will die in moments if nothing is done.

If the players inspect the chest:

> The chest is a beautifully crafted piece, about three feet long, with aged brass fittings that still catch what little sunlight filters through the canopy. Two elaborate latches, each decorated with an engraved serpent, secure its ends. The wood shows signs of age and weather, but the mechanisms appear intact and untarnished.
> 
> (DC 17 Investigation):
> 	Small holes dot the top edge of the chest, easy to mistake for natural wear in the wood.
> 	The chest seems unusually heavy for its size, and rests in a slight depression in the tree trunk's surface.
> 	The brass serpents on each latch face inward, their detailed scales caught in a permanent gleam.

Jhularen Dyrr - Drow spy:
Went by "Julian Drake" or "Jiren Blacktide"
- Equipment:
	- Currency pouch containing 45 gp, 127 sp, 83 cp
	- Traveler's cloak
	- Leather satchel:
		- 3 sets of traveling clothes
		- 1 week's dried rations
		- Merchant's ledger
		- Sewing kit
		- Flint and steel
		- 2 healing potions
	- Waterskin
	- Hemp rope (50')
	- Bedroll
	- dagger matching the one under the chest
	- Bronze signet ring (25 gp)

Physical Setup:
- The chest rests on a slight indent in the fallen log
- Two ornate brass latches with serpent engravings
- Small holes along the top edge that look like wear
- Unusually heavy for its size
- A thin dagger is partially wedged under one corner

The Bodies:
- The drow and half-elf are positioned on opposite sides
- Both have poison puncture wounds on their hands
- They appear to have died simultaneously
- The half-elf's body is slightly twisted, suggesting they might have been trying to lift the chest

Key Clues:
1. A detailed inspection reveals scuff marks under the chest where it seems someone tried to lift it
2. The dagger under the corner seems deliberately placed rather than dropped
3. In the half-elf's pocket is a partial note: "...weight first, then one by..." (the rest is illegible)
4. The mechanisms of both latches make a distinctive "click" when lifted, as if something is locking into place
5. The chest's bottom has a subtle rectangular plate that can be felt but not easily seen
6. The drow's journal contains a crossed-out line: "simultaneously?" with "NO" written emphatically beside it

This setup provides multiple ways for players to discover the solution:
- Investigation of the bodies reveals they tried simultaneously
- The dagger placement suggests they were on the right track with lifting
- The clicking mechanism hints at the latches' ability to lock
- A thorough search might reveal the pressure plate
- The note provides a crucial hint about sequence

The trap becomes a three-step puzzle:
1. Realize the chest needs to be lifted
2. Discover that simultaneous opening isn't the answer
3. Figure out the sequential latch release

Would you like me to develop any of these elements further or add additional clues?
