## Strong Start
- Opening scene: Aethor Kalisk is not at the tavern when they return. The innkeeper just knows he had an appointment and said he would not be back until later in the day. The innkeeper also has a message for the party:
	- Had a Zhelezo inspector in here earlier. Briarfell. Looking for you lot." *emphasize the word 'looking' ominously* "Said you should come by Primework Station. Something about that skyship business." *meaningful pause* "Seemed very interested in finding you. Wouldn't say why.
- Purpose: Force players to choose a path--who to see, where to go.
