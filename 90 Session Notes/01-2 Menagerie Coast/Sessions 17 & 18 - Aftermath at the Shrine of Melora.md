# Pre-Session Prep
## Potential Encounters

### Conversation with [[Rinneth Starsong]]
When roleplaying **Rinneth Starsong**, a balance between cautious openness and protective wariness would be key. Below are some talking points she might share, depending on the direction of the conversation:

#### General Philosophy and Goals (What She’s Comfortable Sharing)
- [x] **"We stand as guardians of balance. The Savalirwood's corruption is not merely a blight but a warning—a ripple from greater disturbances across Exandria."**
      Rinneth might explain the Cord's commitment to protecting and healing the Savalirwood, emphasizing that their work is driven by a belief in maintaining harmony between the natural world and the celestial.

- [ ] **"Our guiding star is the legacy of  the Aurora’s Ascendant. Her wisdom lives in our songs, our visions, and our actions."**
      She might share some of the spiritual underpinnings of their work, emphasizing how they seek signs from the heavens and Seraphina’s legacy to guide their actions.

- [x] **"The Lorestone of Eryndor must never be made whole again. The danger it poses to this world cannot be overstated."**
      She could touch upon their opposition to the restoration of the Lorestone and their belief that its energies, if mishandled, could worsen the rifts or lead to catastrophe.

#### Current Activities (What She Might Cautiously Reveal)
- [ ] **"We’ve been restoring old places of worship, like the Shrine of Melora, believing these sacred sites might hold keys to combating the corruption."**
      If pressed for details, she could mention their efforts to rededicate such sites as a means of bolstering the region's natural defenses.

- [ ] **"The rifts are not just wounds; they are thresholds. We study them to understand their nature, not just to seal them but to heal the land they’ve scarred."**
      She might mention their ongoing studies of the rifts in conjunction with allied druids and scholars, though she won’t reveal specifics unless the players show deep interest and trustworthiness.

- [x] **"We walk a thin line between cooperation and confrontation with other factions. The Obsidian Echoforge shares our goal in part, but their methods are… troubling."**
      Rinneth could provide a neutral perspective on their rivals, hinting at philosophical disagreements without immediately disparaging them.

#### On the Obsidian Echoforge

- [ ] **Measured Tone**: Rinneth would acknowledge the Echoforge's work but emphasize their differing philosophies.
      **"The Obsidian Echoforge are scholars of unparalleled dedication. Their quest for the fragments of the Lorestone is driven by a desire to reclaim lost knowledge. But not all knowledge should be wielded, especially when its cost is so high."**  

- [ ] She would express respect for their academic rigor but disapproval of their willingness to reassemble the Lorestone.

- [x] **Hints at Rivalry**: She might reveal the historical tensions between the Cord and the Echoforge.
      **"We once stood on common ground, allies in the preservation of Exandria’s balance. But time and ambition have driven a wedge between us. They believe in mastery over the rifts; we believe in harmony with them."**

- [x] **Diplomatic Openness**: Rinneth could stress that while relations are strained, they still engage diplomatically on occasion.
      **"There are moments when even adversaries must speak. The rifts do not care for our disagreements, and sometimes, we must coordinate our efforts to avoid catastrophe."**

#### On the Lorestone of Eryndor

- [x] **Grave Concern**: Rinneth would be firm in her belief about the danger of reassembling the Lorestone.
      **"The Lorestone is no simple relic. Its shards hold a power that even those who created it barely understood. When united, it could become a beacon—or a weapon—that disrupts the natural flow of magic and life across Exandria."**

- [x] **Philosophical Opposition**: She would likely contrast the Cord's view with that of the Echoforge.
      **"The Echoforge believe the Lorestone holds the key to controlling the rifts. But power such as this cannot be controlled without consequence. We’ve seen what happens when mortals seek to bind the chaos of creation—it tears the world apart."**

- [ ] **Prophetic Warning**: Rinneth might reference visions tied to the Lorestone and its potential misuse.
      **"I have seen glimpses of what might come should the Lorestone be made whole again. A tide of ruin, spreading like wildfire across the planes. It is not just Exandria that would suffer, but the very weave of existence."**

- [ ] **Call for Caution**: She would likely urge the players to avoid aiding anyone seeking to restore the Lorestone.
      **"If you come across its fragments, I beg you—do not let them fall into the wrong hands. The temptation to unite them is strong, but it is a path that leads only to calamity."**

#### Subtler Hints (What She Might Let Slip with Insight or Persuasion)
- [ ] **"There are those who would see the rifts as a source of power. They do not understand the cost."**  

- [ ] **"I have seen visions of a storm on the horizon, born of greed and ambition. It seeks to consume all."**  

- [ ] **"The forest speaks to us. Sometimes it whispers warnings about those who tread its shadows, seeking its secrets for darker ends."** 
      If the players inquire about threats or dangers in the area, Rinneth might subtly warn them of individuals or groups (e.g., spies or operatives from rival factions) who might cross their path.

- [ ] If pressed about **Lyren Willowwhisper**, Rinneth might cautiously allude to her doubts about their leadership.
      **"Lyren is… driven. I cannot say whether she truly understands the forces she seeks to wield. But the path she walks is fraught with peril, for her and for all of us."**

#### Potential Hooks for Players
- [x] **"If your path aligns with ours, perhaps you could aid us in rededicating the Shrine of Melora or safeguarding one of our scholars."**
      This could lead to a direct mission involving sacred sites or escorting important NPCs.

- [ ] **"There is one who watches the skies like us, but with darker intent. If you uncover such a presence, bring word to me."**
      This could hint at Vaud Qalix’s agents or rogue elements exploring rifts, offering players a potential investigation or conflict.

- [ ] **"If you truly wish to help, there are relics in the woods that we must recover before others do."**
      This could prompt a search for artifacts tied to Seraphina’s legacy or fragments that may lead to larger discoveries.

- [ ] **"There is word of a fragment hidden in the depths of Molaesmyr’s ruins. If the Echoforge seek it, they may not be the only ones."**
      This could set the stage for a race to recover a shard.

- [ ]  **"A courier from Palma Flora carries whispers of their progress. If you find them, perhaps you could learn more."**
      This could lead to an espionage or reconnaissance mission involving the Echoforge’s agents.
