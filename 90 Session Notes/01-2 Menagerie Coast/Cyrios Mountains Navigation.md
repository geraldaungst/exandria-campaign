## Daily Sequence

### 1. ROLL QUARRY PROGRESS (d12)

| Roll | Progress                                     | Points |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1    | **Stalled**: (weather, blocked route)        | 0      |
| 2-3  | **Setback**  (beast attack, injury, weather) | 2      |
| 4-5  | **Slow** (poor conditions, wrong turn)       | 3      |
| 6-11 | **Normal** (steady moderate route travel)    | 4      |
| 12   | **Good** (favorable conditions, shortcuts)   | 5      |

### 2. ROUTE SELECTION (At decision nodes only)

**Player Choice:**

- Easy Route: 3 base points/day
- Moderate Route: 4 base points/day
- Difficult Route: 5 base points/day

### 3. TRAVEL PACE DECISION

**Player Choice - Apply modifier to base route progress:**

- **Slow Pace**: -1 point, Advantage on Perception/Survival
- **Normal Pace**: No modifier, Disadvantage on Stealth
- **Fast Pace**: +1 point, Disadvantage on Perception/Survival/Stealth
- **Push Hard**: +1 additional point, DC 13 Con save or gain exhaustion

### 4. SKILL CHALLENGES & OBSTACLES

See specific route details below.

### 5. TRACKING CHECK

**If players attempt to follow quarry's trail:**

- DC 15 Investigation or Survival check
- **Success**: Learn quarry's route choice (or learn the quarry did not go through this node) Also roll on the [[Cyrios Mountains Chase Clues]] table.
- **Critical success**: Also gains a time estimate for how far ahead they are
- **Failure**: Lose trail
- **Spend extra time searching**: advantage on roll, but failure means spend day searching (-1 points)

### 6. CALCULATE PARTY PROGRESS

**Formula**: Base Route + Pace Modifier + Challenge Results

- Record total secretly
- Give environmental description instead of numbers


### 7. CHECK FOR ENCOUNTERS

**Base Encounter Chance per Day**: Roll d20

**Route-Based Modifiers**:

- Easy Route: +6 to roll (safer, fewer encounters)
- Moderate Route: +3 to roll (some safety)
- Difficult Route: No modifier (more dangerous)

**Pace-Based Modifiers**:

- Slow Pace: +2 to roll (careful observation avoids trouble)
- Normal Pace: No modifier
- Fast Pace: -2 to roll (rushing into danger)
- Push Hard: -3 to roll (exhausted, careless)

**Challenge-Based Triggers**:

- Failed major skill challenge: -3 to roll (complication leads to encounter)
- Failed minor skill challenge: -1 to roll
- Critical failure (nat 1): Automatic encounter

**Encounter Threshold**:

- 8 or lower = Encounter occurs
- 9+ = No encounter today

**If Encounter Occurs**:

1. **Roll d20 on [[Cyrios Random Encounters|Random Encounter Table]]**
2. **Determine Surprise**:
    - Fast Pace or Push Hard: Party rolls Perception with Disadvantage
    - Failed Perception vs encounter's Stealth = party surprised
    - Normal/Slow Pace: Standard surprise rules

### 8. UPDATE PROGRESS TRACKER

- Add party progress to running total
- Add quarry progress to running total
- Calculate current gap between them
- Check if party catches up (same progress total)

## Integration Notes for Skill Challenges

**Failed Skill Challenge Consequences:**

- **Moderate Routes**: Require majority success (more than half)
- **Difficult Routes**: Often require individual success or full group cooperation

**Cart Considerations:**

- Several routes force cart abandonment or creative solutions

- Players must weigh mobility vs. supplies throughout journey

**Skill Check Advantages:**
