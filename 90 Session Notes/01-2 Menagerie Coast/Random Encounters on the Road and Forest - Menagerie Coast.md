| 3       | **Friendly Hunters:** A trio of local human hunters (Garth, Lorren, and Pudge) offers the party some freshly caught game and gossip about strange occurrences in the area. They saw strange green lights last night on a hill east of the woods. (In actuality they were hallucinating after eating some mushrooms they foraged near that hill. Anyone who consumes the meat must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they experience mild hallucinations (disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks) and nausea (disadvantage on Constitution saving throws) for 24 hours.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 10      | **Traveling Monks:** A small group of monks (Tiefling (Master Velkan), Human (Brother Khet), Elf (Sister Niamh *neev*)) devoted to Ioun (goddess of knowledge) are documenting the flora and fauna of the region. They're particularly interested in the balance between wild nature and civilized lands. If the party engages with the monks and the encounter is a positive one, Master Elara <br><br>- **Cobalt Soul Connection**: The monks provide the party with a letter of introduction to any Cobalt Soul archive. This grants them one-time access to restricted texts and potential assistance from archive monks in the future.<br>- **Knowledge Blessing**: If the party shares significant discoveries with the monks, Elara performs a brief ritual blessing them in Ioun's name. This grants each participating party member a d6 that they can add to any skill/ability check (not saving throw) anytime within the next seven days. |
