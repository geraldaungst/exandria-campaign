# Draconia's Final Flight

You simply MUST hear the tragic tale of Draconia's doom—a story that still sends shivers through the Menagerie Coast taverns where I perform! Picture it with me: a magnificent city of dragonborn floating among the clouds of Exandria—yes, FLOATING!—held aloft by ancient arcane moorings and powerful sigils carved by the first dragonborn mages.

Draconia was order personified! A society as structured as a perfect musical composition, where every note must stay precisely in its place. The highborn Draconbloods with their magnificent wings ruled from crystal spires that caught the sunlight and threw rainbows across the sky. They had libraries filled with tomes of arcane knowledge, collections of artifacts that would make the Cobalt Soul scholars weep with envy!

But below them? The Ravenites—wingless dragonborn—condemned to toil in the lowlands beneath the floating city. Imagine! Born without wings and told it made you lesser! Forced to serve, to build, to maintain the very society that scorned you. The Draconbloods created a perfect system... perfect for THEM, that is.

Their military might? Legendary! Draconblood sorcerers hurling spells while soaring through the skies! Diplomatic ties to the Dwendalian Empire itself! Security so tight that not even a copper piece could enter without being counted thrice!

But then... the Chroma Conclave struck. Not one dragon, not two, but FIVE ancient chromatic dragons of unspeakable power, aligned in purpose for the first time in known history! While the others attacked Tal'Dorei, the white dragon Vorugal—the Frigid Doom himself—set his sights on Draconia.

Those perfect defenses? Shattered like thin ice! Those mighty spells? Brushed aside like autumn leaves! The arcane moorings failed, and can you imagine? The floating sections of the city—PLUMMETING to the ground below! Thousands lost in an instant! The survivors, both winged and wingless, suddenly equals in their devastation and terror!

You see, my friends, even the most rigid order cannot withstand true chaos unleashed. The Draconbloods believed their system unbreakable, their hierarchy divinely sanctioned. But nature—especially dragon nature—cares nothing for our careful systems and plans.

Which is precisely why a clever halfling like myself knows when to seek worthy companions on dangerous roads... like yourselves! One must adapt to survive this chaotic world!

# Whispers in the Sewers

"What I'm about to tell you is NOT for the faint of heart—nor for those loyal to certain... authorities in Zadash. But you look like individuals who appreciate the true stories behind official histories, yes?

Zadash—crown jewel of the Dwendalian Empire's western expansion, with towers reaching toward the heavens and markets bursting with goods from every corner of Wildemount! On its surface? A clockwork masterpiece of imperial efficiency! The Righteous Brand soldiers patrolling every street corner, Crownsguard watching every gate, window and doorway. The Cerberus Assembly's mages monitoring the city with arcane eyes, and the King's Hall processing paperwork in triplicate for so much as a new market stall!

But BENEATH this perfect imperial facade? A labyrinth! Ancient sewers and tunnels, some dating back to the city's founding, others carved by creatures best not named in polite company! Massive chambers forgotten on official maps, waterways diverted and abandoned centuries ago. A whole invisible world where the city's refuse—both material and social—was meant to disappear.

Enter the Myriad—the cleverest criminal syndicate in all Wildemount! While the Empire counted coins and cataloged travelers above, the Myriad made these forgotten passages their highways. They established hidden entrances beneath taverns and noble homes alike. They bribed minor clerks with major gold, replaced official documents with forgeries so perfect even the authors couldn't tell the difference! They poisoned officials who couldn't be bought—slowly, mind you, making each death seem natural.

And at the center of this web? The Gentleman! A water genasi of extraordinary cunning! From his headquarters beneath the Evening Nip tavern, he orchestrated it all! His agents infiltrated tax offices, judiciary chambers, even the Righteous Brand's lower ranks! For nearly two years, they operated unchecked, until the Myriad effectively controlled half of Zadash's true power!

Their mistake? Ambition outpacing caution! A greedy lieutenant tried to assassinate a Starosta too soon. The plot was discovered, and suddenly the Crownsguard was investigating every shadow, every whisper! Many Myriad members were captured, but The Gentleman? Vanished deeper into his watery domain!

But here's where the story becomes truly interesting, my friends. Those who frequent the Evening Nip these days whisper that something's... different about The Gentleman. Since those events, he's changed. His operations are less elegant, more brutal. Some say his eyes sometimes glow with an unnatural light when he thinks no one is watching. Others claim they've seen him speaking to empty corners as if someone—or something—stands there!

Could it be paranoia after his narrow escape? Or perhaps... something found him in those dark tunnels beneath the city? Something that offered power at a price? Who can say?
