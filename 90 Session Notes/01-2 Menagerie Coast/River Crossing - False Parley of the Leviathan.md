In a deep, slow-moving section of the river where it widens between two steep, forested banks, a group of merrow have established a temporary camp in a submerged cave beneath the eastern bank. Led by Vess'lokar the Shallowpriest, they've traveled inland seeking a hidden shrine to Uk'otoa in a mountain lake.

# Approach
"The path you are following leads down into a narrow crevasse where a stream cuts between steep rock walls. The water runs about 10 feet wide here, flowing over what looks like a natural stone ford. Ahead, the crevasse opens up where the stream widens - you can see a flat area on this side that would make a good rest spot, and the crossing looks manageable there too. Do you want to head down to the ford here, continue to the wider area ahead, or see if you can follow the rim of the crevasse?"

## Map Reveal
[After they make their choice] "Now that you're closer, you can also make out what looks like a cave opening in the eastern wall where the water forms that small inlet. Let me show you what this looks like so you get a better sense of the geography." [Reveal map]

# Encounter Trigger
As the party moves toward the cove area or begins examining their crossing options, fog suddenly billows across the water's surface (Vess'lokar casting fog cloud). When they approach through or investigate the fog, they'll see a merrow with elaborate shell decorations and coral adornments partially emerging from the water with webbed hands raised in an apparent gesture of peace.

## Hidden Threat
Downstream in a deeper pool, partially concealed among reeds and river debris, lurks a giant constrictor snake (60 HP, AC 12) that the merrow have brought with them from the coast. Vess'lokar carries a Trident of Fish Command and can use it to bring the snake into battle if things go poorly.

## Perception Mechanics

- Characters with passive Perception 20+ (after -5 penalty for disadvantage from fog): Notice ripples in the water indicating two large creatures swimming to flanking positions
- Characters with passive Perception 15 (after penalty): Sense something unusual in the water but can't identify what
- Active Perception checks: DC 17 with disadvantage to spot the merrow warriors positioning for ambush

## Conversation Points Vess'lokar Might Use

- "Surface-walkers know mountain waters? Vess'lokar seek ancient waters, deep and still, where moon reflects three times."
- "I seek no trouble with your kind today. My journey is sacred, blessed by the Leviathan."
- "Many days I travel, far from salt waters. Surface-walkers share knowledge of path ahead, and I share treasure from below."
- "Your weapons... powerful magic? Leviathan favors those with strength. Perhaps you worthy of his blessing."

# The Ambush
During conversation, Vess'lokar will subtly position the party nearer to the water's edge. Once the flanking merrow are in position, or if the party shows too much suspicion, the Shallowpriest will suddenly call out "Uk'otoa sees your worth!" - the signal for attack. The warriors will fire harpoons from the water while Vess'lokar casts lightning bolt or another offensive spell.

If the battle turns against the merrow, Vess'lokar will use the Trident of Fish Command to summon the giant constrictor snake from downstream. The snake will attempt to grapple and drag party members underwater while the merrow continue their assault.

# Treasure

- 4 aquatic gemstones:
	- Storm pearl - medium gray - 65 gp
	- Abyssal quartz - dark blue - 50 gp
	- Leviathan Scale - flat, metallic teal stone - 70 gp
	- Nautilus agate - spirals of blues, white, gray, and amber - 60 gp
- A decorative coral and gold armband worth 110 gp (worn by Vess'lokar)
- Trident of Fish Command (uncommon magic item)
- Potion of Water Breathing

# Cliffside Cave
If the players investigate the cliffside cave, here is what they would find:

**Background:** This cave was recently a bandit hideout but has been taken over by a small group of merrow led by Vess'lokar the Shallowpriest. The merrow are seeking a hidden shrine to Uk'otoa in a nearby mountain lake. They've only been here for a day or so, and the signs of the previous occupants are still fresh.

**Overall Atmosphere:** Damp, dimly lit, and smelling of stagnant water, fish, and decay.

## Room 1: Entrance Chamber


> [!info] 
>  The cave mouth leads into a chamber partially submerged in murky water. The air is heavy with the smell of damp earth and something vaguely fishy. Several soggy bedrolls are scattered around the edges of the chamber, and the remnants of a cold fire pit sit near the entrance.

The entrance to the cave opens into a partially flooded chamber. The water is about 2-3 feet deep in most areas.

### DM Details:
* **Lighting:** Dim light from the cave entrance. Torches or light spells are recommended.
* **Bedrolls:** 3 damp and slightly moldy bedrolls. A DC 12 Investigation check reveals a few scattered coins (5 sp, 2 cp) and a rusty knife hidden in one.
* **Fire Pit:** Contains cold ashes and fish bones.
* **Crude Drawings:** Scratched into the walls are simple drawings of stick figures hunting and fighting.
* **Triggered Trap:** A pile of rocks has fallen from the ceiling near the back of the chamber. Mixed in with the rubble are bits of broken shell, a few scales, and some dried blood. A DC Investigation or Nature check will reveal that a merrow was likely caught in the trap, though there are no signs of a body.
* **Smell:** The lingering smell of crushed shellfish is noticeable near the triggered trap.

## Room 2: Bandit Storage Chamber

> [!info] 
> This chamber is slightly elevated above the flooded entrance, and the air is noticeably drier. Several crates and barrels are scattered around the room, many of them broken open. The contents appear to have been hastily ransacked.

A smaller, drier chamber leading off to the left of the entrance.

### DM Details:**
* **Lighting:** Dim light from the entrance chamber.
* **Crates and Barrels:** Mostly broken open and looted.
	* One crate has been torn open, and much of the dried meat and hardtack is gone. Some has been scattered on the floor, attracting insects.
	* The barrels are empty.
* **Stolen Goods:** A sack lies overturned on the floor. A few scattered coins remain (5 sp, 11 cp), as well as a pair of bone dice and 2 bottles of cheap wine.
* **Map:** A rolled-up map of the surrounding area is wedged behind one of the crates, slightly water damaged but still legible (DC 15 Investigation to locate it). A DC 12 History or Survival check reveals it shows several routes through the local region of the mountains, including one marked "Safest route" in a simple code. The rough paths on the [[Cyrios Mountains Navigation]] chart are marked on this map.
* **Weapons:** Two rusty short swords, a hand axe, and a quiver of mostly broken arrows lean against the wall.

## Room 3: Flooded Altar Chamber

> [!info] 
> The passage opens into a large, echoing chamber filled with murky water. At the far end of the chamber, you can make out a crude altar made of piled stones, partially submerged. The air is thick with the smell of stagnant water and decay. The altar appears to be unfinished, with some stones carefully placed and others simply lying nearby.

### DM Details:
*   **Lighting:** Very dim. Light sources are essential.
*   **Water Depth:** 4-5 feet deep.
#### Underwater Altar
The altar is made of piled stones and decorated with seaweed and barnacles. It is clearly unfinished.
	*   Scattered around the altar are a few crude stone tools covered in algae and rust.
	*   A few small, decaying fish are scattered around the base of the altar, but they appear old and untouched.
	*   The area around the altar is littered with large, amorphous masses of dark brown waste (giant snapping turtle droppings).
	* A DC 12 Investigation check reveals that the merrow stashed the bandit loot inside the altar. (See below for the details.)

#### Lost Treasure:
A DC 16 Investigation check at the bottom of the murky water reveals a small, waterproof pouch containing:
	*   A string of pearls worth 75 gp.
	*   A scroll of *Protection from Evil and Good*.

#### Giant Snapping Turtle
A massive **snapping turtle** (use Giant Snapping Turtle stats) dwells in the murky depths. The merrow fear it and give it a wide berth, believing it to be a favored pet of Uk'otoa. They occasionally leave offerings of fish near its lair (though not recently). The turtle is generally lethargic unless disturbed or approached too closely.
	*   **Tactical Note:** The turtle has advantage on Stealth checks in the water due to its coloration and the murky conditions.
*   **Tactical Note:** The water in this chamber is difficult terrain. Characters without a swim speed or water breathing abilities will be at a significant disadvantage.

### Bandit Loot in the Altar:
- 355 gp, 15 ep
	- On closer examination, about 10gp worth of the coins appear to be a collection of exotic coins from across the Lucidian Ocean (worth 60 gp total to a collector)
- A silver locket containing a pressed flower (worth 25 gp)
- A collection of rare herbs and spices (waterlogged, worth 50 gp total if dried and preserved)
- A _potion of healing_ disguised in a spice bottle
