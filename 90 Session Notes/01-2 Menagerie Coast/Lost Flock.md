A herd of sheep has wandered onto the road, causing a blockage. The shepherd (Darvan Woolfeld, human) is nowhere to be found, and the party must decide whether to help guide the animals back to their pasture or continue onward. (Possibly adds a half day to the journey.) If the party attempts to return the sheep, they will find Darvan unconscious under a tree. 

He was struck on the head by a falling branch during a brief but intense windstorm earlier that day. He has a nasty gash on his forehead and is suffering from a concussion.

Once awakened (requires a DC 10 Medicine check to revive safely), he'll be extremely grateful for the party's help. In his addled state, he'll insist on giving them:

1. One of his sheep – a particularly stubborn ewe named "Northstar" that consistently wanders off and causes problems

2. A "magical protection charm" that he swears has kept wolves away from his flock for years – actually just a small, oddly shaped rock with some sheep wool tied around it with twine. Despite being completely mundane (detectable with even a basic Arcana check), Darvan earnestly believes it has magical properties and will be genuinely hurt if the party rejects his generous gifts.
