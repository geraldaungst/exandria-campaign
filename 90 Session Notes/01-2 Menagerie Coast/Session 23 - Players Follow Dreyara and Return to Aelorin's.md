# Session Prep (1-2 hours)
## Strong Start
- Opening scene: Players are following [[Dreyara Drimvar|Dreyara]] through the streets of Port Damali. 
- Purpose: Party wants to find out what she is up to.
- Connected plots:
- Required prep: Encounter with the Slaadi

## Core Content
### Potential Scenes
1. Dreyara's contact is found murdered by Slaadi
  - Connected plots/NPCs: [[Dreyara Drimvar|Dreyara]], Slaadi
  - Potential outcomes: Party learns of some new information about Dreyara and Rexxentrum

Immediate Reaction by Dreyara:

- "You fool, what did you get yourself into?"

Examining the Scene:

- "These marks... this isn't normal. Not Myriad, not Zhelezo, not even the damned Clasp..."
- "The timing's wrong. Someone knew about this meeting. But who...?"

Upon Closer Inspection of the Body:

- "You were supposed to have the Rexxentrum contacts we needed. Now I have to start over."
- "No signs of theft. They weren't after your possessions. What did they want?"

If She Notices Something Unusual:

- "Not Empire work. Not clean enough. But who else would..." _trails off_

If "strangers" appear:

1. Initial Reaction:
    - She'll immediately adopt her "Vessa Blackthorn" persona
    - Her posture will shift to appear more frightened/concerned citizen
    - "Oh! Thank the gods - we need to alert the Zhelezo! Something terrible has happened here!"
2. If the situation escalates:
    - She'll maintain the frightened citizen act until she has no choice
    - If threatened, she'll try to use the chaos of the slaadi arrival to escape
    - She'll use the teleportation scroll only as an absolute last resort, preferring to maintain her cover if possible
3. If the slaadi appear while "strangers" are present:
    - She might actually try to warn them initially (keeping in character as a concerned citizen)
    - The moment chaos breaks out, she'll use that distraction to disappear
    - If cornered by both threats, then she'll use the scroll

### Secrets & Clues
- [ ] Dreyara has Rexxentrum contacts
- [ ] She uses the alias "Vessa Blackthorn"

### Combat Encounters
- Location: Alleys and streets of the Tumbledowns
- Monsters: Green Slaad, Red Slaad, and Blue Slaad
- Context: Dreyara's contact has been murdered and the slaad are still in the area
- Objectives: Kill the Slaadi, locate the portal through which they arrived, and protect it.
