| 1-3      | **Boot Prints**               | Clear, deep prints in soft earth. Stride length suggests hurried pace, and one print shows a stumble - they're pushing hard.           | Weathered but readable tracks. Steady gait, occasional pause marks near scenic overlooks or trail markers.                           | Faint impressions, mostly eroded. What remains shows confident, unhurried steps with time taken to pick optimal footing.                | **No Evidence:** This path shows no boot prints at all - only animal tracks and undisturbed stone. Your quarry definitely didn't come this way.                                    |
| 4-6      | **Campfire Remains**          | Still-warm ashes with ember glow beneath. Hastily scattered, suggesting they broke camp quickly upon hearing something.                | Cold ashes from 1-2 days ago. Neat fire ring suggests unhurried rest, but limited fuel usage indicates cautious resource management. | Old, rain-soaked ash pile from 3+ days ago. Multiple fire layers suggest they camped here more than once or had time for a proper rest. | **Distant Smoke:** Thin wisp of smoke visible across the valley/ridge. Too far to determine age, but someone made camp over there recently.                                        |
| 7-9      | **Food/Hunting Evidence**     | Bones from hastily-consumed meal, meat still on some pieces. Fire barely hot enough to cook - suggests impatience or urgency.          | Clean-picked bones arranged neatly. Efficient butchering marks suggest time taken to do the job properly.                            | Elaborate smoking setup remains. Carefully prepared jerky scraps indicate they took time to preserve food - or had extra to spare.      | **Scavenger Activity:** Crows and ravens unusually active on the parallel ridge, suggesting fresh carrion or food scraps left by travelers.                                        |
| 10-11    | **Water Source Signs**        | Muddy water still settling at stream crossing. Knee prints in bank suggest they drank quickly without taking time to find clear water. | Clear footprints approaching water source methodically. Water containers refilled here but area left tidy.                           | Constructed small dam or filter system for cleaner water. Time investment suggests no immediate pressure.                               | **Shared Water Source:** Where your path briefly approaches theirs, you find boot prints at a stream junction - they crossed here recently but continued on the other route.       |
| 12-13    | **Shelter Signs**             | Crude lean-to of fresh branches, abandoned suddenly with bedroll still partially rolled. Footprints circle the area nervously.         | Competent rock windbreak from 2 days past. Organized layout suggests routine camp setup.                                             | Elaborate shelter remains with multiple improvements. Stone fire reflector and carved drainage channels show extended stay.             | **No Evidence:** This route shows no signs of recent shelter construction. Undisturbed deadfall and intact spider webs suggest no one has camped here recently.                    |
| 14-15    | **Trail Markers**             | Fresh knife marks on trees marking the path, bark shavings still light-colored. Some marks incomplete as if interrupted.               | Older blazes on trees, methodically placed. Consistent height and depth suggest unhurried but systematic progress.                   | Weathered trail signs, some with additional symbols or corrections added later, suggesting they doubled back or took time to scout.     | **Distant Markers:** From a high vantage point, you can make out carved blazes on trees along the opposite ridge - someone has been marking that route recently.                   |
| 16       | **Abandoned Gear**            | A discarded waterskin with small amount remaining, dropped hastily. Still-fresh food scraps nearby suggest they ate on the move.       | Worn rope deliberately cut and left behind. Clean cut suggests planned weight reduction, not emergency.                              | Old, weather-beaten pack frame stripped of useful parts. Methodical dismantling suggests they had time to salvage what they needed.     | **Wind-Carried:** A torn piece of fabric catches on bushes near your path - fabric that doesn't match local flora. Likely blown from the other route during recent winds.          |
| 17       | **Weather Reaction**          | Emergency shelter materials (torn cloak, bent branches) suggest they were caught unprepared by recent weather.                         | Weatherproofed gear stored systematically under rock overhang. Prepared but not panicked response to conditions.                     | Comfortable shelter with improvements for extended weather wait. Extra firewood stockpiled shows no rush to leave.                      | **Weather Patterns:** You notice the storm hit the other ridge harder - broken branches and fresh rockfall visible there suggest someone may have been caught in worse conditions. |
| 18       | **Hazard Navigation**         | Rope still tied to anchor point for rappelling, cut hastily rather than untied. Scattered rock suggests hurried descent.               | Rope professionally coiled and cached nearby for potential return use. Clean anchor points show careful setup.                       | Multiple rope positions tested, with practice scratches in rock. Final anchor shows optimal placement found through experimentation.    | **Distant Rockfall:** Fresh rockfall scars visible on the opposite cliff face suggest someone recently triggered loose stone - likely during a climbing descent.                   |
| 19       | **Interaction with Wildlife** | Scattered supplies from hasty retreat from animal encounter. Some items retrieved but others left behind in urgency.                   | Signs of planned detour around active animal territory (bear markings, etc.). Cautious but steady navigation.                        | Evidence of successful hunt or detailed animal observation. Time taken to study local fauna behavior patterns.                          | **Disturbed Wildlife:** Mountain goats or birds seem agitated on the parallel ridge, suggesting recent human disturbance over there. Local wildlife on your path remains calm.     |
| 20       | **Path Choice Indicators**    | Backtrack marks where they started down wrong path but quickly corrected. Hurried decision-making evident.                             | Single set of scouting prints exploring options before committing to route. Deliberate but efficient choice.                         | Multiple scouting expeditions visible. Several false starts indicate thorough route evaluation - or indecision.                         | **Path Convergence:** At a distant trail junction visible from your vantage point, you can see someone explored both options before committing to the route away from yours.       |

## Usage Notes:

- Roll d20 when players have opportunity to find clues (not every day)
- Check the appropriate column based on current chase status
- Mark "Used" checkbox to avoid repetition
- More common clues (1-9) represent typical tracking signs
- Rarer clues (16-20) provide more specific story moments
- Some clues work better in specific terrain - adapt as needed# Cyrios Mountains Chase Clues Table
