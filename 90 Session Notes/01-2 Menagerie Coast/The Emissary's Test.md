As the party travels through the dappled forest path in the foothills of the Cyrios Mountains, they come across a small clearing bathed in spring sunlight. In the center lies what appears to be an injured hippogriff, its wing bent at an unnatural angle. The creature has striking coloration - feathers in vibrant spring greens and soft pinks blend into a tawny-gold hindquarters. It watches the party approach with intelligent eyes that seem to shimmer with an unnatural luminescence.

**The Setup:** The "hippogriff" is actually Lady Viridian, a spring eladrin and emissary of Queen Titania of the Summer Court. She wears an enchanted moonbeam circlet (currently hidden in the hippogriff's plumage) that grants her shapeshifting abilities. Lady Viridian was sent to investigate disturbances in the natural balance between order and chaos in this region, particularly related to the activities of the merrow seeking Uk'otoa's shrine.

**Initial Interaction:** When the party approaches, the hippogriff makes weak attempts to stand, only to collapse with a pained cry. It seems particularly interested in the gnome druid, watching them with an intensity that suggests recognition of their connection to nature.

If the party investigates:

- Nature checks (DC 14) reveal the injuries appear strangely inconsistent
- Arcana checks (DC 16) might detect faint traces of fey magic
- The gnome druid feels an unusual resonance with the creature, as if it's somehow familiar despite being their first encounter with a hippogriff

**If the Party Helps:**

_Positive Consequence:_ If the party attempts to heal or assist the "hippogriff," Lady Viridian eventually reveals her true form - a graceful eladrin with hair that shifts between green and pink like spring blossoms, wearing a circlet crafted from what appears to be solidified moonlight. She explains her mission and becomes a valuable ally, particularly to the gnome druid.

She offers information about the merrow's activities and warns that their pursuit of Uk'otoa's shrine represents a significant imbalance that the Summer Court is concerned about. She can provide guidance about safer mountain paths and warning signs of fey influence that might help them navigate the region.

_Negative Consequence:_ Their kindness puts them on Lady Viridian's radar, and while grateful, the eladrin will consider the party now connected to Summer Court affairs. At some future point, she will reappear to request their assistance with a matter of importance to Queen Titania - a request that will be difficult to refuse without offending powerful fey entities.

**If the Party Ignores the Hippogriff:**

_Positive Consequence:_ The party avoids entanglement with fey politics and obligations, which often involve complex and binding arrangements that can have unpredictable consequences.

_Negative Consequence:_ Lady Viridian observes their callousness and reports back to the Summer Court. As the party travels through natural environments, they begin to notice subtle hindrances - paths that should be clear become overgrown, water sources are mysteriously difficult to find, and forest creatures seem unusually standoffish or hostile. These minor inconveniences persist until they perform some act of kindness to the natural world that might balance their previous indifference.

**Revelation:** If the party helps, as Lady Viridian returns to her eladrin form, her circlet glows with moonlight, and she explains that she was testing the compassion of travelers in the region, as fey emissaries often do. She thanks them for their kindness and offers a small token of appreciation - a tiny seed that glows with the same moonlight as her circlet. She explains that if planted during the spring equinox, it will grow into a small tree with leaves that shimmer with fey light, creating a minor connection to the Feywild.

**Connection to Campaign:** This encounter introduces your order vs. chaos theme subtly through Lady Viridian's mission to investigate imbalances in the region. It gives your gnome druid a personal connection to the fey, potentially opening future storylines involving the Summer Court. And it provides a natural way for the party to learn about the merrow's activities without directly encountering them yet.
