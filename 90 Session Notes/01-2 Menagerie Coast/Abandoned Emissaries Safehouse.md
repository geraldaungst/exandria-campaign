# Exterior

> You stand before a narrow townhouse wedged between similar structures on a winding street in the Tumbledowns district. The building has a faded blue paint job, weathered but intact shutters, and a small wilting plant by the door. A soft glow of candlelight can be seen through the front window on the ground floor. Like most homes in this part of town, it's modest but lived-in, showing the expected wear of the Tumbledowns without appearing neglected.

## On closer inspection (DC 12):

- The plant by the door is not dead, but it hasn't been watered in a while
- The front step has been recently swept

## Harder to notice (DC 18):

- A small, unremarkable scratch near the door frame (thieves' cant marking)
- The lock on the door appears sturdy and new, and it is better quality than what you would expect to find in this neighborhood

# Front Room

> You enter a small room that serves as both living and dining space. A single candle burns low on a rough wooden table, its flame casting long, dancing shadows across the walls. Wax has dripped down the side of the table, hardening in small puddles on the threadbare rug below. The table sits off-center, surrounded by three mismatched chairs. Several empty bottles lie scattered beneath the table. Against the far wall stands a bookshelf with warped shelves holding a few water-damaged books and an empty drawer that appears to have been pulled out and hastily searched.

## On closer inspection (DC 12):

- There is a spot on the table with a thin layer of dust and small flakes that appear to be clay
- One corner of the rug is turned up slightly, revealing the edge of a floorboard that wasn't properly secured. If the rug is lifted completely, an obvious loose board is visible with an empty space underneath

## Harder to find (DC 18):

- Among the books are ledgers with coded entries dating back several months. The code is not familiar to any party members.
- A scrap of parchment under one table leg contains part of a message about "taking the item to our expert".

# Kitchen

> The cramped kitchen reeks of spoiled food and cheap alcohol. Unwashed dishes pile in a basin, while dried food crusts on a cutting board hint at recent hurried and simple meals. A half-full sack of provisions sits in one corner. Rat droppings dot the corners, and you can hear faint scuttling within the walls. A back door shows signs of frequent use, with mud tracked in from the alley.

## On closer inspection (DC 12):

- The provisions include hard bread, dried meat, and a small spice box containing some black flakes and a red-orange powder (see below to identify the spices).
- Knife marks on the doorframe appear to be tallying something or someone

## Harder to find (DC 18):

- A loose brick near the hearth conceals a small pouch with 3d4 silver pieces
- The spices in the spice box are black salt and Xhorhasian fire root. They are associated with cuisine in southern Xhorhas, and Xarzith Kitril in particular.

# Bedroom

> Upstairs, the bedroom contains a thick straw mattress laid directly on the floor, covered with relatively clean blankets. A few clothes area strewn about. The window overlooking the street has been covered with a dark cloth, carefully pinned to allow someone to look out without being seen.

## On closer inspection (DC 12):

- The clothes would fit a humanoid the size of a Dwarf.
- Scratches on the wall next to the bed are grouped in clusters of 7. There are 18 marks.

## Harder to find (DC 18):

- A small rectangular item has been recently removed from the corner, leaving an outline in the dust

# Storage Room

> This smaller room appears to have been repurposed from simple storage to a planning space. Four nails protrude from one wall, small triangular scraps of parchment still pinned beneath them, forming the corners of what was probably a large document. A small table holds scattered papers and a half-used bottle of ink. The corner contains a pile of empty sacks and a coil of rope.

If players look inside or beneath the sacks, they will find crumbled pieces of crushed clay. Two larger pieces are easily visible in the dust. They are remnants of replicas of the Shards of the Lorestone of Eryndor.
* Anyone familiar with the Lorestone shards will immediately recognize the shape and carvings on one of them as a fragment of a known shard, with the line, "beam herald hope's bright sight"
* The other one is unfamiliar. The shape, curvature and runes suggest it is another shard, and it in fact fits together with the known one, but the line engraved on it is not a known line.
* The runes translate to, "loom in twilight's reach as cosmic"

## Harder to find (DC 20):

- Faint chalk marks on the floor outline what might be a building's layout; players will recognize this as a rough floor plan of Aelorin's hideout
- A hidden compartment in the wall contains a set of thieves' tools
